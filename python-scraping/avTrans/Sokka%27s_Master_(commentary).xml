[<i>Refers to the stark, craggy landscape.</i>] So, this is a-a-another episode, as most of the ones in uh, season three, where the landscape is heavily inspired by uh, some reference photos I took in Iceland, um, these crazy moss covered, uh, volcanic formations. And where the kids are camping, uh, the idea is that the Fire Nation being so in-you know, industrious that they've strip mined a lot of their land for um, minerals so they can smelt metal for their ships and all their war machines. Um, so, originally the idea was that the Fire Nation was gonna be very, uh, industrialized and a lot of strip mines and-and we um, didn't really get that much of it in. [<i>Laughs.</i>] I mean, if you look around through season three, you'll see some factories and stuff, but um, that was, that was the inspiration behind that.

It's interesting to watch Uncle's transformation because, you know, you just think he's this fat old man, but you don't get to be the top general of the Fire Nation and the next person in line for the throne without having something special going on.

But um, it was great, uh, Greg filmed, Greg, uh, Rankin, our videographer, filmed Seung Hyun doing this whole, um, process of-of setting up the paper and the ink, and...

And then after this episode was, you know, we, the designers and I, based this-this amazing, uh... waterfall on this, and it was painted fr-you know, referencing the photos, and then the animation came back, and... and then Mike came into work one day, and he's like, "hey, I, I think I saw that uh, waterfall on..." um, Sunrise, was it Sunrise...

Uh, one day in class, Sifu Kisu turns around and hands me some solid oak nunchuks and says, "here, you're going to learn two section staff now". And I, you know, was very excited, the uh, twelve year old boy in me [<i>Mike chuckles.</i>] was like, wow, my own nunchuks. And-but he recognized this look on my face, and he says, "uh-uh, don't, don't think I'm giving t-you these because you're good.

I mean, there were-there were multiple sessions for this episode. But um, for this whole crazy fight in the end, um, its-you know, and it's not even a fight, it's more of a test that um, that Piandao is putting Sokka through.

And um, and the-the storyboard artists, uh, M-Mike Chang, um, sort of, you know, took pieces of it. But, there we are, I'm standing up on these bleachers, uh, Kisu's down on the ground, we're t-fighting, I got stabbed in the leg, even though it was a foam sword, [<i>Bryan and Kisu laugh.</i>] it hurt really bad, and the door opens up, and Serena Williams walks in to the gym, [<i>Mike chuckles.</i>] and... she says, "wow, what a, you know, what a great way to uh, what an amazing job you-you s-you know, you-you work so hard and stay in shape".

<td>I think more importantly too is um, you know, when a-when a master selects someone to pass on something rare, he's really looking for someone that is going to preserve it. Because these arts are getting rarer and rarer all the time. Um, you know, who uses a sword to fight anymore? You don't use a sword to fight, you use a sword to-to develop, you know, your skill, and to develop your-your energy and to move your chi, your life force energy, beyond your hands, through your weapon, into your opponent's weapon, into your opponent. And um, so it's something much greater than, you know, just learning to poke a hole in somebody, it-it-it teaches you self-control, and um, you know, uh, spatial awareness, and, um, it-it raises a spirit. It-it makes you a more enlightened person, it jus-if your mind isn't in the moment every second you have a sword, you're gonna cut yourself really bad.

</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>
<td>[<i>Brief pause; refers to Piandao complimenting Sokka's ingenuity throughout their fight.</i>] And the cool thing is even though it looks like he's bent on, you know, really doing Sokka in, he's teaching him the whole time, [<i>Bryan affirms.</i>] with all his commentary, in all of the angles.

</th>
<td>Well, you figure that like this guy is so good that, I assume you've had experiences like this, Kisu, where like, he's obviously in control of every move he does, [<i>Kisu affirms.</i>] he's not gonna do anything that would actually... permanently [<i>Bryan affirms; laughs.</i>] injure Sokka.

</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects.</i>] It's not-it's not a pretty thing, a sword fight. A sword fight is all about finding the vital point of your opponent, [<i>Bryan affirms.</i>] and poking it. [<i>Mike chuckles.</i>]

Some volcanic activity. [<i>Brief pause; refers to the exterior shots of Piandao's castle.</i>] Then uh, was a new background team that did these, um, paintings, in Korea, and they just came out so beautifully in this episode. Uh...

[<i>Refers to Toph metalbending the chunk of meteorite into the Nickeolodeon "splat" logo.</i>] So, it's a little, uh, tribute to the Nick splat that lives [<i>Mike chuckles; Kisu affirms.</i>] in the lower right corner of our screen.

</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects.</i>] Yeah, I remember that was in the script, and I was like, whoa, whoa, we're not going to really do that, are we? And then we did it. [<i>Bryan laughs.</i>] It's-it's kind of funny, I like it.
