[<i>A badgerfrog croaks at him. Angrily.</i>] Well, what's your answer? [<i>The badgerfrog hops on his head before hopping away.</i>] Yeah ... that's what I'd say, too. How am I supposed to convince these people that I'm on their side? What would Uncle do? [<i>Imitating Iroh.</i>] Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self, reveal itself. [<i>Normal voice.</i>] Even when I'm talking for him I can't figure out what he means. What would Azula do? [<i>Imitating Azula.</i>] Listen, Avatar, I can join your group, or I can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends. Your choice. [<i>Normal voice.

His next shot fails to escape, causing an explosion around him resulting in the building he stands on getting destroyed. Cut to his metal arm as it flies away from the explosion, followed by the falling building. The gang looks on, shocked. Haru, Teo, and The Duke all appear from behind a pillar also shocked.</i>

</th>
<td>Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday, I've been through a lot in the last few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world. [<i>To Toph.</i>] I'm sorry for what I did to you. [<i>Bows to her.</i>] It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally.

When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love. I'd like you to teach me. [<i>Bows before Zuko.</i>]

<td>You might have everyone else here buying your ... transformation, but you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past. [<i>Approaches him; threateningly.</i>] So let me tell you something, right now. You make one step backward, [<i>Close-up of Zuko.</i>] one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore. [<i>Close-up of Katara's angry face.</i>] Because I'll make sure your destiny ends ... right then and there. Permanently.
