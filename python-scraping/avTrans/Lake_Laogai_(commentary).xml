<td>And we see more of the Dai Li. I don't know if you guys hit on this, but the Dai Li were named after the secret police of Chiang Kai-shek. [<i>Mike gives an affirming murmur.</i>] So, and they are the secret police of Ba Sing Se, so that... history of oppression lives on, and-and...

</th>
<td>Yeah.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>The-the concept of the, the rings really worked out well with like a different architectural style, and sort of a different level of, like a class system, you know, realized in architecture. [<i>Refers to Joo Dee.</i>] And that's based on Miken Wong, our, uh, production manager.

[<i>Mike affirms.</i>] We've been working together on various shows around town. And she's still happy somehow. [<i>Tim laughs.</i>] So, we had her do some acting reference in the video... footage.
</td></tr>
<tr>

</td></tr>
<tr>

</td></tr>
<tr>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>Yeah, that's a really great addition.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects; refers to the long shot of Team Avatar exiting the house.</i>] What's funny is they-they blew a whole in the building, but they use the door still. [<i>Mike and Bryan laugh.</i>] We just had this idea that they-I think in the script, she broke a pot, or just like a vase, but we were like, let's just have her blow half the house apart. And then when you see it in the subsequent episode, there's like scaffolding, [<i>Laughs.</i>] they're trying to fix it up.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>I did want to mention that next door to them in the house, [<i>Mike and Tim laugh.</i>] is-was a neighbor named Pong...
</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects.</i>] Yes.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>... that I put into many scripts in Ba Sing Se that just, he never made it on.
</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>
<td>Yeah. Well we saw-we did see him in-in, in the, the first episode where they're in Ba Sing Se.
</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>
<td>Oh, that's right, they talk to him very briefly.
</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>

</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects.</i>] At one point he-didn't he end up in the prison?
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>Yeah, he was...
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects.</i>] Yeah, he was in the prison, and yeah, the Dai Li was tracking him, they grabbed him out of his house. He had a whole backstory.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>Yeah, he was like a major character [<i>Tim affirms.</i>] for a while, and then.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects.</i>] No offense Tim, but I don't miss it.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>Yeah. [<i>Mike and Bryan laugh.</i>] Well, [<i>Laughs.</i>] I think I might be the only one whose-has a hankering for more Pong.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>[<i>Laughs; refers to the fireplace emanating green light on the room and the characters.</i>] So, the idea with this green fire, I'm not sure if we've touched on this, is that usually we just use uh, in the Earth Kingdom, we use these phosphorescent crystals for a light source. Um, they don't use fire that much, sort of a prejudice against firebenders and whatnot. Um, but the ide-we had this idea that, I don't know, there was some rare crystal that was, um, maybe fused with some kind of gaseous substance, and it could-it could burn. It's like a really long-lasting artificial log or something. [<i>Mike laughs.</i>] And it has a green flame because of the gaseous... releases.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>But I imagine it being very fragrant as well.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>It is...
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>[<i>In the background.</i>] Like an evergreen scent.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>... it's like a potpourri-yeah, [<i>Mike laughs.</i>] it's evergreen. It's a-it's lime mint, is what it is.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>[<i>Laughs; refers to Iroh asking what Zuko to consider what he wants his life to be like.</i>] That's some classic Uncle advice.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>So, Tim, when you write a script, and then, you know, often there's like a long gap before you see the final, you know, product.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>Uh-huh.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>Are you ever surprised at the end, you're like, "Ah, I had no idea that was gonna come out like that," or, or...
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects.</i>] Yes, all the time. [<i>Mike laughs.</i>] Almost always there's something in there that's, usually there are always like some visual jokes [<i>Mike affirms.</i>] that aren't in the script. [<i>Refers to Toph gluing a poster on the wall backwards, and thinking it's upside-down.</i>] Although this was in the script, [<i>Mike laughs.</i>] where she puts it on backwards. But uh, yeah, I mean especially-or like battle scenes, you never really know how that blocking is going to work out, [<i>Mike affirms.</i>] when-when you see that in the end, and this has a great fight scene in it. That-all that stuff [<i>Bryan affirms.</i>] is, is always amazing to see for the first time. [<i>Brief pause; refers to Jet approaching Katara.</i>] There's our man.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>Yeah, so this is the first time Katara's seen Jet since uh, season one, when he... broke her heart.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>Yeah.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>So to speak.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>[<i>Refers to Katara attacking Jet.</i>] They had a loving relationship.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>Yeah... yeah. This is-this is a woman scorned right here.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>[<i>Laughs.</i>] She...
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects.</i>] But I really-what I like about Jet's character is like, he was, he's always been kind of... troubled, you know. [<i>Tim affirms.</i>] He's-he's-he's, he's... he had good intentions, but [<i>Tim affirms.</i>] kinda went about the wrong way to, to-to solve problems I guess.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>[<i>Refers to the tense theme that plays during Jet's closeup shot.</i>] Ooh. Yeah, Jet has the kind of classic, on the edge, between good and evil, he means to fight the Fire Nation but he goes too far, and it raises questions about, you know, the difference between the Freedom Fighters and terrorists, and, that's-there's some really deep thematic stuff [<i>Mike affirms.</i>] that goes on with Jet.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>[<i>Brief pause.</i>] Jet was designed by uh, Ryu Ki Hyun, who's a great animator and designer we met, uh, at JM Animation. And uh, we, we just loved his drawings, and, um, when episode 110 came into production, we, we gave him the assignment of designing Jet and the whole gang of, uh, Freedom Fighters.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>[<i>Refers to Toph checking to see if Jet is lying.</i>] And this, t-right, this is the first time we see Toph with her lie detecting ability.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>Yes, this is the...
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Tim
</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects.</i>] With her heartbeat, which is...
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects.</i>] The idea that she sees with vibration, so, she can sense... she's kind of like a polygraph, she can sense a change in-if everything's quiet enough, and-and she's concentrating, she can sense a, a change in someone's heartbeat, and... kind of biorhythms.
</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>
<td>[<i>Refers to Old Sweepy.</i>] Here comes Old Sweepy!
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>Yeah.
</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>

</th>
<td>They're kind of...
</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>

</td></tr>
<tr>

</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>
<td>They're always, they don't use, like, instead of, "the army", they're like, [<i>In a crotchety, old man voice.</i>] "army makes the stuff here", [<i>Mike and Tim laugh.</i>] you know, just-just, they jump right into the sentence.
</td></tr>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>[<i>Brief pause.</i>] I think that was what was kinda cool about Ba Sing Se, is like we had set it up as this like Shangri-La, great place that, you know, the kids really wanted to get to, and all their problems would be solved once they got there, and they get there and they discover this crazy conspiracy, and like, just dark underside to the Earth Kingdom, which is cool.
</td></tr>

</td></tr>

If you have one-on-one, it's-it's... it's, it's difficult, but it's I think, uh, much harder to keep track of a bunch of different characters all fighting at the same time. [<i>Refers to the Dai Li using their unique earthbending against Team Avatar.</i>] There's some great moments of seeing the Dai Li grabbing people, and creating these rock pillars, and running up the walls, and all this stuff, it's great. Very exciting.

<td>[<i>Refers to the long take of Toph fighting off four Dai Li agents, taking them down with earthbending in quick, near simultaneous succession as they try to flank her from either side on rock pillars.</i>] This-this shot's one of my favorites right here. The symmetry of Toph taking out those [<i>Mike affirms.</i>] two guys.
</td></tr>

</th>
<td>Yeah, and the great idea that Toph can't see the fists always [<i>Mike affirms intermittently.</i>] flying at her, you know, 'cause they're flying through the air. [<i>Refers to Jet breaking the rock gloves the Dai Li sends at him.</i>] Some excellent hook sword action. [<i>Mike gives an affirming murmur.</i>]

<td>Yeah, she knows the line of action, she can feel someone strike at her, but yeah, it might be hard for her to time, time the fist in the air. [<i>Refers to the room filled with pipes that Aang and Jet confront Long Feng in.</i>] This room came out really well. [<i>Refers to Long Feng trying to bribe Aang with Appa's location.</i>] Clancy Brown, fantastic voice actor, uh, does Long Feng.

Really wants his father's approval, even though he's kind of torn what he thinks about his father.
