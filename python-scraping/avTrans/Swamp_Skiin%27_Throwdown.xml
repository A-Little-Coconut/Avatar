[<i>Runs over to it.</i>] See, your filthy swamp water sits in this hollowed-out pumpkin. Then the sunlight makes the water evaporate, leaving behind the swampy impurities.

<td>[<i>Sarcastically.</i>] Yes, genius. It leaves behind the filthy swamp flavor. Then the clean water vapor collects on the leaf, and drips into this nice, sanitized cup. [<i>Holds up the cup and takes a refreshing drink.</i>] Ah! I do love clean water.

Sokka tries to swamp ski again, but quickly gets pulled underwater. When he resurfaces, he finds he is now riding on Slim, who manages to bite off Sokka's trunks again as he jumps onto a tree branch. Aang, riding on one ski, swings by, and a camera shutter clicks when he passes Sokka. Sokka's face becomes red. Cut to Sokka attempting another round of swamp skiing. He loses one ski and crashes into tree vines. Aang splashes Sokka, and Aang does a large trick to jump on the head of Appa, who is also skiing. Cut to later, when Sokka is resurfacing from another round of swamp skiing.</i>
