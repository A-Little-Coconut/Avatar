Sokka is lying in a blue sleeping bag next to the fire. The camera zooms in on Aang and Katara atop Appa. Aang sits on the bison's head and is checking the knots that tie the reins to Appa's horns.

His expression turns to one of shock as he looks up and sees that Zhao has jumped up and is soaring through the skies toward him. With a loud scream, he lands at Zuko's feet, erects himself and thrusts his fist forward to deliver the final blow.</i>
<p><i>Cut to Zuko's eyes, which open wide in fright as the fire reflects in them. At the last possible second, a frontal shot of Zuko shows him rolling out of the way and swirling his feet around. The view switches to a side-view of Zuko as he, while getting up in this swirl, swipes Zhao's legs from underneath him. This same move is shown two more times, from a closer side-view and from a close-up angled shot of Zuko's perspective, before cutting to a shot of Zuko's feet as he firmly plants them on the ground. Close-up as he smiles confidently. Switch to a shot from over the ground as Zuko steps forward, sliding fire at Zhao's feet, who steps back. Zhao is caught off balance and wobbles backward. Zuko keeps repeating his move, directing his attacks at Zhao's feet in an attempt to throw him off balance. Switch to Zhao, who falls back in distress and subsequently to Iroh, who smiles approvingly. Cut to Zuko, who directs a powerful kick at his adversary. Zhao barely pushes it out of the way while staggering back ever further. Zuko kicks again and this time he succeeds in knocking the commander over. Zhao falls down and rolls over the ground, where he ends up on his back. Zuko runs up at him and threatens him with an outstretched arm, ready to deliver the final blow. Zhao brings his head up and looks at Zuko. Close-up of Zuko's eyes and back to a shot of Zhao's face.</i>
