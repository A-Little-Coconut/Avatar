She subsequently breaks the ice into several smaller blocks with some difficulty, causing the pieces to fall down. Finally, Katara joins the pieces again, thus "joining" Sokka back as well. Sokka uses his own strength to break out of the ice. She and Aang begin to bicker.</i>

<td>Guys, come on, [<i>Both look toward Toph, who is standing with her arms rested on two vertical earth columns.</i>] I think air and water are both wonderful elements.

Cut to Toph's confidently smiling face as she points her hand toward a direction.</i>] But earth beats the pants off both of those sissy elements combined!

<td><i>She stomps the ground with one leg, as the camera pans right to show Sokka, who is walking away to avoid being used to show a bending art's greatness. He is pushed above by two diagonal earth columns, and is sent flying to a vertical surface. He is used as a ball in a pinball-styled game as Toph creates many projections to change his direction. As he moves from one projection to another, he literally becomes ball-shaped, and finally falls inside a sleeping Appa's head on top of the vertical surface. Appa suddenly stands up with his six legs stretched out. Appa spits Sokka from his mouth, causing Sokka to go flying. He is stopped by Aang, who airbends him to ensure a safe landing.</i>

[<i>Camera zooms out to show Aang airbending a lot of air into Sokka's mouth, causing Sokka to inflate. Sokka is unable to open his mouth, making him unable to talk properly as he rises into the sky above.</i>] Aang! What are you doing?

Sokka helplessly waves his hands and lets go of the air Aang airbent into his mouth when he impales himself on Appa's right horn. He is sent flying due to the force of the air coming out from his mouth and spins in many circles before falling into a pond with a splash. Cut to Toph and Katara looking disappointed as Aang grins widely and laughs behind them.</i>

She raises a giant portion of the earth above and delivers an earth fissure to the side, raising a mountain-shaped and sized portion. She raises many mountains, creating a chain of them. Cut to the mountains from outer space, which show that they create a picture of Toph herself. She pulls a heart-shaped giant portion of the earth down, creating a heart near her face. Cut to Toph showing the photograph of this, with Katara and Aang visibly angry and jealous. Upon seeing its photograph, Appa gives her an "8.2" mark, Momo, a "7.6" mark, and Iroh enthusiastically applauds.</i>
<p><i>Cut to a confident looking Aang as he makes a small ball of air in his hand. Camera zooms out as he makes a large dome of air and jumps high into the air by using the dome as a trampoline. He gets a cape and, while rising above, eats a part of a cloud. He reaches outer space and, after shivering for a moment, makes a ball around himself and descends down very fast, leaving a trail as he does. Aang lands down on the ground with a confident expression, and grins. Appa gives him an "8" mark, Momo, a "6" mark, with Iroh waving his finger in an unimpressed manner.</i>

Appa, Momo, and Iroh turn their heads to a side as they see a volcano erupting and a lava wave coming out of it rapidly. Zuko emerges from it and bends the lava into a dragon.</i>
