She eyes her opponent with a look of determination. Sangok looks at her with a frightened expression on his face, shaking slightly. He summons a globule of water, freezes it into an iceball, and fires it at her. Katara, however, is quick to melt the iceball and, turning around swiftly, bends a wave of water at him, which she proceeds to freeze, thus suspending Sangok in an icy trap.</i>

He emerges from the surface and inhales deeply several times. He proceeds to duck his head under the water, surveying the area. The camera zooms in on another channel. Zuko swims toward the channel and upward. As he attempts to resurface, however, the surface of the water had frozen into a thick ice patch. Zuko tries to break through the ice. He suddenly exhales, signaling his need for air. He heats his hands using firebending and melts a hole in the ice. Cuts to a tunnel way in the city, the ice steaming and finally melting away. Zuko emerges and catches his breath. He relaxes against the wall of the tunnel. The scene changes back to the Spirit Oasis, where Aang is meditating, Katara and Yue watching him.</i>

Water begins rising around Zuko and encircling him. Katara waves her arms about wildly, forming a ball of water around him which she freezes solid. Cuts to close-up of her as she smiles triumphantly.

Just as his fingers grasp Aang's collar, Katara fires a water blast, throwing Zuko to the other wall. She whips up a large wave and sends the attack at Zuko. The rush of water sends Zuko up the side of the cliff; she freezes the water, encasing him in ice. Cuts to Pakku who looks over the horizon in the city as the sun rises.

With a determined look on his face, he breathes steam from his nose, melting the ice quickly. He lands on the ground and fires a blast at Katara, who had her back turned to him at that moment. She turns around swiftly and attempts to deflect the blast by conjuring a water shield; however, she creates the shield too late. The blast sends her slamming into the gate to the Spirit World, knocking her out. Smoke from the impact fills the screen. Cuts to shot of Zuko standing over her, holding Aang by the collar.</i>
