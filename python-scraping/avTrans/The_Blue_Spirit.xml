After a pause, Zuko lets loose a huge fireball at him, but Aang dodges and flies away on a current of air. Zuko watches him hop away from tree branch to tree branch and out sight. Cut to Zuko as the camera slowly zooms backward. Zuko raises his eye in consideration. Fade to a close-up of the swamp, where Aang is collecting frozen frogs once again. Cut back to a wide shot of Zuko's ship reeling in the cutter vessel back into the mother ship. Shift to Zuko, sullen, walking past his Uncle on the main deck.</i>

She cries out and it hops out of her mouth. Both Katara and Sokka begin spitting and coughing, Sokka rubs his tongue in panic against Appa's fur.</i>
