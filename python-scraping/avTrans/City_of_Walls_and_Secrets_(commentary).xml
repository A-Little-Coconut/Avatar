</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Elsa
</th>
<td>The background design supervisor, yes.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>Yeah, which means when we have a script, um, a new script, we sit down and talk about on id-ideas about like the locations, and um, since <i>Avatar</i> is sort of like a travel show, we don't have a lot of reused locations, so every episode we have to draw all new designs for the... the backgrounds are the-like the places, the insides are the buildings, and fields, campsites, whatever. So, uh, Elsa heads up, um, a couple great artists. Uh, do you want to tell them about the artists you work with?
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Elsa
</th>
<td>Yeah... yeah, I have two wonderful people that I work with, excellent professionals. They are Jevon Bue and Enzo Baldi, they have been helping me out since season two, since the end of season one-no season two. And uh, we have been-they've been doing a fantastic job, uh, we have been doing all these wonderful designs for all these locations, as-that Bryan has said, and sometimes even if we're re-revised new locations, we add up to... to all these new places that we go to and revisit. It's always interesting 'cause we-there's always sometimes even if you revisit, there all these new extra little places that we, uh, redesign, and yeah. It's all so full of surprises.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>Yeah, we sometimes take an opportunity to improve upon a, uh, past design if we do see it again.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>And this, uh, this episode was especially challenging, and this whole location Ba-of Ba Sing Se, because we knew we were going to spend multiple episodes at this place, and it had to really feel like a real, real city, and which is, I think when you see it, that's what comes across to me, is like how real this place feels, like all the different, you know, rings where they go in, the Lower, Middle, and Upper Rings and, and all the great houses and landscapes and everything, so, great job Elsa on all the awesome background designs.

<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects; refers to the man who sits in between Sokka and Toph on the train.</i>] By-by the way, the guy with the corn was a little tribute to uh... <i>Invader Zim</i>, and if you know the episode, then you get a cookie. [<i>Mike laughs.</i>]
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Elsa
</th>
<td>[<i>Laughs.</i>] Well, it was pretty interesting beginning with Ba Sing Se, um, I was dreading it a lot for a longest time, I knew it was going to be a lot of work, and it was a lot of design involved, but I think it was a fantastic experience.

<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>[<i>Refers to the train station Team Avatar arrives at.</i>] This was fun to do things like subway cars and train stations that didn't feel too contemporary or, um, or even futuristic, um... you know, its-its, I like-I like the inclusion of like the rooftops on the subway cars, like their little buildings, and even the inside, I mean it feels like a New York subway, and it's-it's familiar, but obviously the ancient <i>Avatar</i> version.

</td></tr>

<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>[<i>Refers to the establishing shot of the Lower Ring.</i>] So, this is the Lower Ring, as Joo Dee just said.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>And uh, the color supervisor Hye-Jung Kim and I talked about how we could, you know, Elsa... distinguished the different rings architecturally, and then uh, Hye-Jung and I decided, you know, we'd have a different color rooftop scheme and like building scheme for each. So, the-the Lower Ring was um, a lot grittier, a lot more monochromatic, not very you know, not very colorful.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Elsa
</th>
<td>It was a lot of fun to design the Lower Ring, because it had a lot of flavor of, uh, we were uh, inspired by many towns in-in China, uh, Yangtze and uh, the one that's specially, uh... Yangtze province, the um, the central part of it was a big inspiration for all these marketplace areas, and it was very colorful and nice, and [<i>Refers to the extreme longshot of the marketplace road Zuko and Iroh are walking on.</i>] we-especially this background particularly, that's what we wanted to capture, the flavor. 'Cause it's, it is a, a low, rundown place, but it's also has so-has some charm to identify it.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>Yeah, we wanted the, in the Lower Ring, since it's uh, where they keep the refugees an-and the-the poorer working class people, they wanted to have less trees, like it's overpopulated, and you know, the rich people, as you go up in the rings, less buildings, more trees, more parks and rivers, and um, so they sort of force all these lower class people to live on top of each other and the streets are... kind of organically windy and you know, just... just haphazard and as we go up into these districts you start to see more organization, and...
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>So uh, Tim Hedrick who's supposed to be here today, he's the writer of this episode. Unfortunately, he's not here, but uh, he and the other writers and-and Aaron, our head writer, did a great job kind of establishing this new city, you know, we-we knew we were gonna go to Ba Sing Se, we knew this was going to be a big location in season two, but we hadn't worked out all the political, you know, intrigue and everything that ends up going on in Ba Sing Se, so they-they played a, a big part in-in shaping that, and kind of coming up with this, you know, <i>1984</i> sort of utopian, seemingly utopian society that turns out to be a little, little creepy under the surface.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>Yeah, we knew, Mike and I, early on knew... that, it-there was always going to be something wrong with this city, you-you'd think that, oh, they're the good guys, they're on their side in the war, and they'll definitely help them. We knew we wanted it to be that when the-the kids showed up that somehow or another, they would end up being enemies of this place, um. So often the case in the real world, there's just a lot of shades of grey, and, and uh, everything's not so cut and dry. [<i>Refers to the Upper Ring.</i>] So, here you can see in-in the Upper Ring it's just beautiful, idyllic, it's like pastures and parks, and... [<i>Refers to the palace gate the Dai Li are standing under.</i>] this is based on the uh, the South Gate to uh, the Forbidden City in uh, Beijing where Mike and I got to go... uh, I think a year, year and a half ago.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>Yeah, we even based, I think the doors on that were, there's only like certain doors that the emperor can go through, and the aside doors are where everyone else has to go through, so later on in the party, I think we have the, the uh, the guests of the party they're entering cer-through a certain, uh, side door, not the main one.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>[<i>Refers to Team Avatar's house in the Upper Ring.</i>] This was a really important location, um, 'cause it's, it's where the kids would be living for several episodes, which was very weird, it's very unlike <i>Avatar</i> to have like a apartment, you know, that we keep coming back to. It's almost like a sitcom.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Elsa
</th>
<td>Even if we revisited it, we visited different rooms of that same place, so.
</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>
<td>[<i>Brief pause; refers to Joo Dee describing the house as nice.</i>] It is pretty nice. I wouldn't mind...

</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>
<td>Yeah, after them, you know, camping out for two seasons, it's kinda cool that they get to [<i>Bryan affirms.</i>] settle down and hang out in a place.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>But it was fun to, when we were doing the storyboards inside this location, you know, these-these are sort of worldly, earthy kids who don't have parents or teachers around, so it was fun to like come up with staging ideas where they're just, Aang's laying on the bannister and Sokka's has his feet on the painting, and stuff like that, like... [<i>Refers to the cat owl.</i>] There's that weird cat owl, [<i>Mike and Bryan laugh.</i>] you know. I think that's voiced by my neighbor.

</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>
<td>[<i>Interjects.</i>] Fantastic job.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Mike
</th>
<td>... yeah, great job with the, making-again, making this place feel like a real place. I mean a lot of the shots in this, cinematography of the whole location really came out beautifully.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>And Chris Graham, uh, was one of the board artists, did a really great job on a lot of these shots. [<i>Brief pause.</i>] So, the other two board artists on this episode were, uh, Kenji Ono and Dean Kelly, both, uh, classmates of mine at the Rhode Island School of Design.

<td><i>A pause in the commentary occurs until Katara asks the team's new neighbor, Pong, who he would get in trouble with for talking to them.</i>

<tr>

</th>
<td>So this guy, Pong... [<i>Laughs.</i>] as their wacky neighbor was, we had kinda wrote him into some subsequent episodes, but he ended up-kept, he kept getting cut out, [<i>Laughs.</i>] 'cause he was just kind of like extra weight that we didn't end up needing. But he became kind of an inside joke with the-all the writers, Pong their wacky old neighbor. [<i>Refers to Jet spying on Iroh and Zuko in their apartment.</i>] So, this little subplot with uh, Zuko and Jet is definitely one of my favorites of-of, this is a continuation kind of from the uh, previous two episodes where Jet met Zuko, and-and Zuko didn't want to be in his gang, and Jet's taking that very personally at this point, and-and trying to prove that Zuko is in fact a firebender.
</td></tr>

</th>
<td>Jet's one of those guys who, you know, he was around in our place in time would always be into conspiracy theories and, you know, everyone's against him.

</th>
<td>Yeah, Jeremy, like master of many instruments, pulled out the cello and did these like extended techniques for all that kind of 1970s psychological thriller score stuff for Jet. Just something wrong with Jet, something deep in his brain, that-that theme of his, we flex that.

</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>Yeah. [<i>Refers to the sequence where Jet and Zuko duel each other in the tea shop, using the tables and chairs as weapons and footing.</i>] So some of the choreography here was... the fight choreography, we were inspired by just the classic uh, Hong Kong kung fu movies where they really make use of like props and things that are, you know, in the room, and jumping up on the table, and then maybe someone cuts that in half, and then you have to balance on it, you know. Just trying to um... trying to like use the environment for, to-to make the fight unique. [<i>Refers to the clothing worn by the party attendees.</i>] Uh, love to mention, uh, Angela Mueller, who did, uh, character design on this episode, I-all of these, um, costumes, these fancy costumes are just amazing, I think they came out really great. [<i>Refers to Long Feng.</i>] This is Long Feng, voiced by Clancy Brown. He's a fantastic actor.
</td></tr>
<tr>

</th>
<td>Yeah, Long Feng ended up being a really cool villain for season two, I think.
</td></tr>

It's just nice that the king has a, you know, a little pet to keep him company.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th>Bryan
</th>
<td>It's sort of... it-it's a good character, uh, building thing for the king. He's, he's a good guy, but he's just sort of innocent, naÃ¯ve, so it made sense that he just had a big... kind of dumb pet.

It was, uh, very interesting, I like nuances and flavors, and it-but I do like exteriors more than interiors. Landscapes are fine though, but sometimes [<i>Bryan gives affirming murmurs intermittently.</i>] even they're harder to pull through... to make 'em real, them real. [<i>Refers to the street outside the teashop, set during nighttime.</i>] This area here was beautiful, this teashop area was, to me, was lovely.

[<i>Refers to the fireplace emanating green light on the room and the characters.</i>] So, the idea here, if you're wondering about this fire, um, generally for Earth Kingdom locations, uh, for light sources we don't use torches or lamps, anything with fire.
