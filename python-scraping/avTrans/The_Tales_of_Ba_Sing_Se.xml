<td><i>Scene changes to a very tall tree, so tall that it towers above the clouds. Appa flies up through the clouds and over to the tree. Shot cuts to show many fruits hanging from vines on the tree. Appa hovers underneath these and Momo, who was sitting on the sky bison's head, flies up and begins eating some fruit and tosses some down to Appa who eats them. As Momo continues to chew on one of the fruits, Appa suddenly roars very loudly.</i>
<p><i>The screen flashes white and shot cuts to Momo asleep on the windowsill of Team Avatar's house. Startled by the thunder that woke him from his dream, Momo leaps up into Sokka's Earth Kingdom bag that is hanging nearby. After some seconds, he pokes his head up and realizes he has some white fur lying on his head. Momo sniffs the fur, and shot cuts to a shot of Appa and Momo flying to indicate this is what Momo is thinking of. Appa roars again, and shot cuts back to Momo, as he chatters and realizes to whom the fur belongs.</i>
</p><p><i>Cut to a shot of the house form the lawn, with Momo visible through the window. A shadow that is very similar to Appa's crosses the ground. Cut back to Momo as he wraps the bunch of fur around one of his front legs, and soars out the window of the house and into the yard to investigate if this shadow belongs to the sky bison. As he emerges from a tree he flew up into, he realizes that the shadow is a cloud's. Disappointed, he holds his arm up and looks at the fur tied to it, but chatters a bit as he notices something. Shot cuts to show that on the other side of a house's roof, is what appears to be the head and horns of Appa. When Momo flies closer, however, he finds out it was only a tree with white leaves and branches sticking out in a way similar to Appa's horns. Momo lands on one of these branches and his ears drop in disappointment.</i>
</p><p><i>Scene changes to a street as Momo soars above it. He lands on a water barrel, and begins to drink from it. As he does, his wagging tail accidentally knocks over a stick sitting nearby. It falls to the ground with a noise that alerts three pygmy pumas who were rummaging in the garbage nearby. The pygmy pumas growl at Momo and suddenly pounce on him. Momo manages to dodge and runs into a box with an opening big enough for him but not enough for the panthers. The three pumas surround the box and growl, with two of them trying and catch the lemur through the openings. Momo manages to escape from an opening in the back of the box and flies away. The pygmy pumas chase him by running on rooftops, as one of them manages to push him to the ground. After hitting the ground, Momo gets to his feet and runs on foot into a group of people, and the pumas do not follow their prey into the crowd.</i>
</p><p><i>Momo is picked up by a man in the crowd and has a green little hat stringed to his head. He is tossed inside the circle of the people where two monkeys are already dancing to the beat of an organ grinder. After standing for a moment, Momo dances along. The crowd all cheer and clap for the dance, and the pumas stalk the lemur outside the circle of people, looking in between the legs at their prey. One of the monkeys jumps onto Momo's head and balances with its hand, the other doing the same on the first monkey's head, as Momo struggles to keep balance.</i>
</p><p><i>Just as Momo is about to lose his balance, the pumas roar and attack him. Momo flees again, but this time as he tries to fly away, one of the pumas grabs him, which slows him down. The other two panthers jump on and grab onto Momo, and all four creatures crash into the ground. When the dust clears, Momo is pinned to the ground by one of his the predators while the other two stand ready to strike their catch. However, before they can, a net flies in, captures all four of them, and drags them off.</i>
</p><p><i>Scene changes to the animal control officer placing Momo into a cage and locking it by placing a peg in to prevent the doors from opening. As the cart begins to move, Momo rubs the clump of Appa fur still tied to his arm against his face. Scene changes to an overhead shot of a small one-storied building, before cutting to inside the building, to show chicken meat. The cart has been pulled up inside the building. The butcher hits a log of wood with his knife. Shot cuts to shows the animal catcher and the butcher arguing, but their dialogue is only gibberish, as it is from Momo's perspective. Shot cuts to the three pygmy pumas, who are lying in the cage next to Momo, scratching at their cage and growling. Momo reaches through the bars and removes the peg that holds his cage shut. As he pushes the cage open and begins to run away, he stops and looks back. The pygmy pumas stare at him sadly from their cage. Sympathetically, Momo leaps back onto the cart and begins to remove the peg to free them. Cut to the two men approaching, but when the men reach the cart, they find both cages deserted as right behind them, as Momo and the panthers make their escape on the rooftops.</i>
</p><p><i>Fade into a scene on the roofs of the city, as Momo and his three new friends sit and watch the clouds. One of the panthers is affectionately rubbing against Momo. Suddenly, one of the panthers uses its mouth to remove the bunch of Appa's fur from Momo's arm. The panther with the fur runs off, with the other two pumas following, and Momo, chattering loudly, follows them as well. The panthers lead Momo through the streets of Ba Sing Se till finally one of them places the bunch of fur on a footprint shaped on the ground. Momo lands on the hole as the pumas run off. Momo looks at this strange hole and realizes that it is actually a footprint made by Appa. Chattering, Momo lies down on the ground holding the bunch of fur. The camera zooms back to show the panthers sitting nearby, watching as the rain begins to fall on Momo, lying on the large footprint. Fade to credits.</i>
