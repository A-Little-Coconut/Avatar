            <description>The episode opens in Fire Fountain City, where a giant statue of Fire Lord
                Ozai roaring is shown with flames coming from the fists and out of the mouth. The
                camera moves down to Toph, who is seen running from someone, but turns around and is
                caught with a net and falls to the ground. She angrily looks in front of her at
                someone.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The camera cuts to a shot of Katara, who is glaring back at
                Toph.</description>

        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Crosses her arms.</charAction> You brought this on yourself. I had no
            choice. <charAction>Turns away from Toph with her arms folded.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Toph is dragged away in the net, all the while glaring back at Katara. The
                screen fades to three days earlier. Toph and Katara are seen facing each other, each
                taking a fighting stance, the latter controlling two streams of water in her hands.
                Aang appears on the screen, tying his headband over his eyes like a
                blindfold.</description>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Okay. I'm ready for some training.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>He turns to face the girls and takes two steps forward in a stance similar
                to Toph's. Upon impact with the second step, he picks up vibrations from the ground
                with seismic sense. He quickly dodges three earth pillars that appear out of the
                ground near him. He hears a water attack coming from Katara and redirects it at her.
                He quickly launches a boulder at Toph who catches it and stops it.</description>

        <speech>Good job, Twinkle Toes. Visualize, then attack.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>She launches the boulder back at Aang, who burrows into a hole with
                earthbending. The boulder instead hits Katara square in the chest, knocking her
                down. She stands back up and brushes dust off of her.</description>

    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Katara's eyebrow twitches and she glares at Toph with her vein shown on her
                head before she angrily creates a wave and sends it at Toph, who gets splashed by it
                and becomes annoyed.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Katara creates an ice ramp, and Toph creates an earth ramp, both proceeding
                to head straight for each other. They crash and both of the girls go
                flying.</description>

            <description>Meanwhile, Sokka is seen hiding behind Aang with an evil smile. He quickly
                gets up and charges at Aang. The background changes to a rushing one.</description>

            <description>Aang, casually and still looking away from Sokka, creates an earth wall,
                which stops Sokka dead in his tracks. He lowers the wall, which causes Sokka to fall
                down.</description>

    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Katara waterbends a stream of mud at Toph, knocking her down. She quickly
                gets up and earthbends a pillar underneath Katara, which sends her flying toward a
                wall. She starts running toward Katara, but stops at the last second when they hear
                Aang.</description>

            <description>Aang, Sokka and Toph head to Fire Fountain City. Sokka is carrying his
                sword horizontally across his shoulders. He looks up and sees messenger hawks flying
                in and out of a large coop.</description>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Look at all those messenger hawks! You know, I've been thinking about getting one
            for myself. That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone. I could just send them
            messages.</speech>

        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>
        <speech>I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you. <charAction>Sokka glares at

        <speech><charAction>While holding up a silver piece.</charAction> So, guys. What are we

    <p>
        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Stops walking.</charAction> We can get more money. <charAction>They both

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>In the area is a table with two men sitting across from each other, with
                people around them watching the action. The table has three shells on it, all upside
                down. The first man places some money on the table and the second man, a scam
                artist, lifts the shells to reveal that the middle one has a rock underneath it. He
                places the shells back down as they were and starts moving them
                around.</description>

        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>
        <speech>This is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage. Everyone guesses wrong
            because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute. But I can feel it with my
            earthbending. <charAction>As she says this, the scam artist continues to move the shells
                around as the gambler tries to focus on the shell with the rock, and right before
                stopping, the scam artist quickly and inconspicuously earthbends the rock from
                underneath one of the shells into his sleeve.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The scam artist stops moving the shells and arranges them how they
                originally were: Horizontally right in front of him. The gambler points at the shell
                in the middle, which the scam artist lifts to reveal nothing underneath. The gambler
                stands up and walks away crying. A few more people move and the dealer notices Toph,
                and that she is blind.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Toph sits in front of the table and feels around it, pretending to be
                helpless. She places their last silver piece on the table. The scam artist shows the
                rock under the shell in the middle and starts moving them around. This time, he
                tosses one rock from his sleeves into each of the two empty shells. Toph senses this
                and smiles slyly. When he stops, Toph points to the one on her left, which has a
                rock underneath, winning about two silver pieces.</description>

        <speech>Forty silver pieces it is. <charAction>Drops some more money into the bag and starts

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The scam artist moves the first two rocks into his sleeves, which Toph
                senses as she smiles slyly again. He attempts to do the same with the third rock,
                but Toph inconspicuously clutches her fist, causing the rock to move back underneath
                the shell, which the scam artist does not notice. When he stops, she smiles and
                points at the shell in the middle.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Moves his hand over to the shell, about to lift it.</charAction> Sorry,
            little lady, but- <charAction>Lifts up the shell and sees the rock, which shocks and
                confuses him.</charAction> Huh? <charAction>Stares closely at the
            rock.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut to Toph, Aang, and Sokka heading back to camp, laughing and carrying
                baskets full of goods. Katara is seen cooking something in a pot as they all drop
                their baskets onto the ground and Katara looks at the baskets with
                curiosity.</description>

                screeches at her, and runs away.</charAction></speech>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The camera switches to the city, where Aang goes from bowing to doing
                tricks with the money in his hands and runs off. A few citizens are seen playing a
                dice like game. The two winners see Toph holding a bag of money and call her over.
                She tosses the two die. One lands on three, which is the highest number, and the
                other is about to go from three to zero. Cut to Toph, who twitches her head to the
                left slightly without any of the others seeing, causing the die to move back to the
                three, meaning she wins much to the winners' dismay and Sokka's and Aang's
                joy.</description>
            <description>Cut to an area where a carnival is being hosted, where a big man tries a
                test-your-strength game, in which you need to use a hammer to launch a ball up to
                ring the bell, but can only make it about halfway. Toph jiggles a bag of money and
                walks over. Aang and Sokka watch from behind as she hands the man in charge of the
                game the money and places her hands on the hammer. She struggles to move it over her
                head and behind her, which makes all in the crowd snicker and laugh. Toph smiles
                again as she uses earthbending to launch the hammer's head from behind her to the
                lever with great force. The ball is launched so hard that it launches out of the
                game, destroying the top of it, which leaves everyone shocked. She casually grabs
                her winnings and leaves as the ball crashes into a tent behind, causing everyone to
                cringe at the sound, and looks back to see the damage.</description>
            <description>The camera next cuts to a street where a carriage is being pulled by a
                dragon moose. Cut to a side-shot of the inside of the carriage where a noble opens
                his cup of tea to his delight and waves the aroma to his face. Toph emerges from a
                dark alley and creates a small rock right in front of one of the wheels to stop the
                cart. She falls back, pretending to have been hit. The noble peeks outside the
                carriage window and sees Toph. He jumps out of the carriage and starts to run, but
                is stopped by what looks like a Fire Nation guard, who is really Sokka in his Wang
                Fire costume. He notices Toph being "run over" and crosses his arms angrily at the
                noble, who gets on his knees and begs Sokka. He places twelve small bags of money as
                bribery, one after another in Sokka's arms, and Sokka smiles and winks at him to
                assure him that Sokka will keep this secret. The camera cuts to back at
                camp.</description>

        <speech>They were controlling over you, so you ran away, and now you act like your parents

    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Speaking of that "third-eyed freak", I think I've come up with a name for him. What

            <description>In town, Sokka just bought a messenger hawk, which he names

    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar. My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner, and as such
            I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't wanna see any
            fighting. <charAction>Scratches Hawky on the stomach.</charAction> Good little messenger
            hawky. Who's got pretty feathers? <charAction>While walking away, he notices a wanted
                poster he had just past with Toph's picture on it. He gasps in horror and rips it
                off the wall. Hawky screeches.</charAction> You're right, Hawky. This is bad.
                <charAction>Suddenly, the bird poops while standing on Sokka's
            arm.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The scene changes to back at camp. Katara and Aang are practicing
                waterbending, while Toph is counting her money. Sokka walks up to her.</description>

        <speech>Toph, while I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like.
                <charAction>Pulls out the wanted poster and shows it to her.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>
        <speech>Well it sounds like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's on the
            sheet of paper.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>It's a wanted poster. Of you. They've nicknamed you the Runaway.</speech>

        <speech><charAction>Happily.</charAction> A wanted poster! That's so great! "The Runaway." I

        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Looks a few times at both the wanted poster and Toph.</charAction> Well
            yeah, actually, it does look pretty good. <charAction>Gets back on topic.</charAction>
            But, Toph, you're missing the point. Maybe Katara was right. These scams are drawing too
            much attention to us.</speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>
        <speech>Don't be such a worrywart like your sister. <charAction>Stands up and walks up to

        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Ponders for a moment.</charAction> Well, that is true. I had this idea

            Here's a little extra, so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation. You know

        <speech>Of course you do. <charAction>Grabs the wanted poster and tucks it into her

        <speech>Hm. Uh, I never actually thought about that. Hawky, <charAction>Points away from
                himself.</charAction> Gran Gran, South Pole. <charAction>Hawky shakes
                himself.</charAction> I think he gets it.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Momo appears on Aang's shoulder and screeches at Hawky. He jumps to Sokka
                and starts chasing Hawky around Sokka's head.</description>

            <description>Later on at camp, Katara is mixing something in a cooking pot via
                waterbending. She waterbends some of it out of the pot and into Appa's mouth, which
                causes him to lick his lips, while Aang sits on a ledge in front of Appa and drinks
                something out of a cup. Toph and Sokka, the latter with Hawky on his shoulder, show
                up carrying big bags of money.</description>

            <description>Later on at camp, Sokka and Aang are sitting together. Toph and Katara are

        <speech><charAction>Talks into Aang's ear.</charAction> I'm going to send a note to Katara

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Sokka positions Hawky on his arm and places the note in Hawky's message

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>I guess Plan B is we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>I think we're gonna run into a similar problem. <charAction>Hawky

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Toph exhales, annoyed. The camera cuts to another area of the camp. Katara

        <speech>When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but
            Katara? She had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She
            helped fill the void that was left by our mom.</speech>

        <speech>I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly?
            I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like my whole
            life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there.
            And now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture.
                <charAction>Katara, touched by what Sokka says, is reduced to
            tears.</charAction></speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>
        <speech>The truth is sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing.
            She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me. <charAction>Wipes away
                tears from her left eye.</charAction> You know, the real me. That's more than my own
            mom. <charAction>Katara, deeply touched by Toph's words, sinks slightly into the water.
                Toph punches Sokka in the arm.</charAction> Don't ever tell her I said any of
            this!</speech>

            <description>At around nightfall, Katara is sitting next to Momo, who is napping with
                Katara rubbing the top of his head. Katara is looking down in front of her,
                saddened. She sees Sokka and Toph walking toward her and walks up to Toph. When they
                reach each other, Sokka keeps walking.</description>

                Katara puts her arm around Toph's shoulder, who gives a sly smile.</charAction>
            Whaddaya say, Toph? Just me and you. One last go. You in?</speech>

        <speech>
            <description>The scene changes to Katara and Toph going over the plan. Katara is looking

    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>The plan is simple: This wanted poster says you're worth a lot of money; Ten times
            more than you've made in all of your scams. So I'm gonna turn you in and collect the
            reward. Then you metalbend yourself out of jail, and we're on our way. <charAction>As
                she speaks, the screen fades to the beginning of the episode, where Toph is seen
                running from the authorities and is caught in a net.</charAction></speech>

        <speech>
            <description>Toph is dragged away in the net, all the while glaring back at Katara.
                Katara glances back slightly and gives a sly smile. She is joined by the chief of
                authorities.</description>

            <description>Meanwhile, a female guard drags Toph into a jail. She throws Toph from the
                net into a wooden cell and closes it. Toph feels the floor of her cell, but is
                shocked when she can't sense any earth in it. She gets up and looks outside the cell
                at the guard.</description>

            <description>In an office, the town authority grabs a box underneath a desk and looks
                around in it. A door opens behind Katara, who is standing across the desk from the
                chief. The chief closes the box and points at Katara.</description>

            <description>Katara turns and sees the assassin with the third eye tattooed on his head,
                aka "Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man", walk in, leaving her shocked and horrified. Meanwhile,
                at camp, Sokka and Aang are worried, the latter pacing back and forth.</description>

            Appa's in charge. <charAction>Appa lifts his head as the two animals start screeching at

    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The camera cuts to Toph's cell, which now holds Katara too. They both are
                sitting on the floor, downcast, when Toph suddenly realizes something.</description>

            <description>Katara embraces Toph. Meanwhile, Sokka and Aang walk around town looking

            <description>The assassin jumps down from the roof and fires another blast at them. They
                barely dodge it, but get sent flying back by the blast, which shakes the ceiling of
                Toph and Katara's cell. Toph is trying to break out, while Katara is sitting

            <description>Katara exhales deeply and wipes her forehead with the back of her hand. Her

                waterbending to use the midair sweat as blades to cut through the wooden cage. Toph
                stands up upon noticing this.</description>

            <description>Katara waterbends another blade of sweat, this time from under her arms.
                Cut to Aang and Sokka being chased by the assassin. The assassin fires a blast at
                them which they dodge but still get sent flying. Sokka crashes onto a wheelbarrow,
                which they hide behind.</description>

                from his right. The assassin fires a blast at the wheelbarrow and blows it up. Aang
                runs past him on a roof to his left. The assassin quickly turns and fires another
                blast, which sends Aang flying into the Ozai statue. He falls from the statue to the
                ground. He looks up and sees the assassin standing above him inhale, about to fire
                another blast at Aang, but his head is suddenly encased in ice. The assassin moves
                and Aang sees Katara, Sokka, and Toph standing behind the assassin.</description>

                Team Avatar, but Toph quickly launches a boulder at the blast, blowing the boulder
                up. A pebble from the boulder flies toward the assassin and hits him square in his
                third eye, which momentarily stuns and angers him. He tries to fire another blast,
                but with his chi is blocked, he ignites the air around him and gets sent back,
                head-first into a wall. When he stands up and shakes it off, Team Avatar is
