        <speech><charAction>Narrating.</charAction> Water, earth, fire, air. My grandmother used to
            tell me stories about the old days. How the four nations once lived in harmony. How
            everything changed once the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four
            elements. Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him
            most, he disappeared. Nobody had seen him for a hundred years until my brother and I
            found him: an airbender named Aang. The problem is this Avatar is still a kid and even
            though his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save
            anyone. The Fire Nation will do anything to capture Aang before he masters all four
            elements. So, I must keep him safe until he is ready to fulfill his destiny. My brother
            thinks I'm crazy, but I believe Aang can save the world.</speech>

                pushes the guards away, expelling fire from his mouth in the process. The messenger

                Appa. As Kya speaks, cut to an aerial view of Sokka and Kya asleep in Appa's
