            <description>The scene opens to a full moon in the sky. The camera pans down and shows
                Senlin Village during early morning hours. Cut to a view from among the houses,
                slowly zooming in on Aang who tries to get Appa to move, yanking on the reins,
                though the bison continually refuses and sits down.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Strained voice.</charAction> Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy!
                <charAction>Appa roars in protest and sits down. Cut to a close side-view; Aang
                sadly addresses his pet.</charAction> Look I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't
            coming to the Fire Nation with us. <charAction>Frontal shot; looks down and away,
                sadly.</charAction> If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself. <charAction>Cut back
                to the side-shot; sternly, emphasizing his command by straightening
                himself.</charAction> So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>He jerks at the reins, stretching them out, but is flung to the ground when
                the ropes pull him back as Appa did not move a muscle. Cut to a forlorn looking
                Aang, sitting spread-legged on the ground.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Voice-over; Aang gasps in surprise and looks over his right shoulder and
                over his left, turning around in search for the origins of the voice.</charAction> I
            think his big butt is trying to tell ya something.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut to a frontal shot of Appa as the camera swiftly pans to the right to
                reveal a collection of Senlin villagers, with Katara and Sokka standing in the
                front.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Desperately.</charAction> Please don't go Aang. The world can't afford

        <speech>
            <description>Aang airbends himself atop Appa's head. Close shot of him looking back with
                a sad expression on his face as he prepares to leave. As Appa stands up, the shot
                changes to a frontal view, and Katara and Sokka run to stand before the bison,
                preventing him from moving any further.</description>

            We got your back. <charAction>Momo soars up and perches atop Aang's shoulder, and Appa

            <description>Appa takes off with Aang, Momo, Katara, and Sokka. Later that morning, the
                Senlin Village leader exits a building, but he stops in his track upon finding Zuko
                standing in his path. In the background, Iroh is sitting on a komodo

            <description>The sky becomes littered with flaming fireballs fired from the blockade.
                View from Zuko's ship as the fireballs fill the sky. Close-up of a screaming Aang,
                Sokka, and Katara. Zoom out as Appa evades numerous fireballs, some exploding
                mid-air. Camera switch to forward view, close-up, as they fly through a blanket of
                fireballs. The team flies directly through one that exploded before them, Appa's fur
                darkened from the explosion. Katara, Sokka, and Momo all slap out embers on Appa's
                fur.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>On the ocean surface, Zuko's ship is narrowly missing many falling
                fireballs. Sheets of ocean water crash over the ship, and crew members run for
                safety. A single fireball explodes on the aft side of the vessel.</description>

            <description>Close-up of Aang's view. Just over a cloud; fireballs burst through
                everywhere and smoke fills the screen. Aang, Katara, and Sokka scream and duck away,
                while Katara and Sokka grip Appa's saddle. Appa dodges many fireballs before two
                collide and explode in front of him. Sokka is thrown from the saddle and begins to
                plunge for the ocean, screaming anew.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Appa reaches Sokka just in time. Katara grabs his hand, pulling him back
                into saddle. Appa skims the ocean surface. A fish appears out of nowhere and slaps
                Sokka square in the face, knocking him into the saddle. Momo leaps up and grabs the
                fish as Appa continues his swift flight mere feet above the ocean. Fireballs crash
                into the water all around them.</description>

            <description>A single catapult launches a fire blast directly toward Appa. Close-up of
                Aang's eye as it snaps open, unafraid. Aang airbends forward off of Appa's head. He
                uses a powerful airbending kick, and the flaming boulder explodes in a large smoky
                blast. Aang falls back to Appa's head, Katara and Sokka grabbing him. Appa soars
                safely over the blockade, passing them.</description>

                banished prince below. Zuko and Iroh look behind them in silence as they sail safely
                through. Iroh strokes his gray beard curiously.</description>

            <description>The scene changes to Sokka slumped in the back of the saddle. Katara is
