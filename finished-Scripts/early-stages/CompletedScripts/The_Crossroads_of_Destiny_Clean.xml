        <speech>So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>I don't know. In my vision, I just knew she needed help.</speech>

        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from
            time to time. <charAction>He looks down and notices a mound of earth passing nearby,
                heading to the wall.</charAction> What is that?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>They fly down and follow the mound. Toph is seen still earth surfing. Aang
                and Sokka come down beside her.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Toph becomes startled at the sound of Sokka's voice and falls backward off
                of the mound. Sokka and Aang cringe upon seeing her fall. Scene changes to Azula
                speaking to the Dai Li.</description>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Azula">Azula</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>While pacing back and forth.</charAction> The Earth King and the Council
            of Five do not trust the Dai Li. They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng. Soon they will
            turn on all of you and eliminate you. Seizing power today is a matter of life and death.
                <charAction>As she talks, an agent with a mustache starts looking nervous and
                slightly lowers his head.</charAction> This coup must be swift and decisive. The
            Earth King and each of the five generals must be taken out simultaneously. Long Feng has
            placed you in my command while we overthrow the government. <charAction>Walks over to
                her left, to another agent with a tiny, vertical scar on his right cheek. When she
                nears him, she stares sideways at the agent while still addressing all the
                agents.</charAction> If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all,
                <charAction>She stops right in front of the scarred agent.</charAction> I will snuff
            it out. <charAction>She continues walking, with the eyes of the now nervous scarred
                agent following her.</charAction> That is all.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The Dai Li leave, and Azula walks up to Ty Lee, who is pouring

        <speech>Nice speech, Azula. It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way.
                <charAction>She hands the cup to Azula. Camera pans over to a close-up of

                <charAction>Camera pans to show the Earth Kingdom Emblem above the palace
                doors.</charAction> But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror. Instead, we
            are the Earth King's personal guests, here to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny
            thing.</speech>

        <speech>Have you met the Dai Li? They're earthbenders, but they have a killer instinct

            <description>Iroh begins drinking his tea. Zuko looks over at him and smiles before
                going behind him. Iroh begins breathing fire. Cut to a corridor outside the room as
                a fire blast makes a hole in the wall, allowing Iroh and Zuko to escape. The Dai Li
                agents begin shooting some rock gloves at them, but miss as Zuko and Iroh turn
                around the corner. Iroh generates lightning and destroys the wall in front before
                jumping down, yelling, into a bush below. Zuko stops at the edge.</description>

    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Zuko turns around and walks back. Iroh smacks his head upon hearing this

    <p>
        <speaker name="Azula">Azula</speaker>

            <description>Zuko shoots a fire blast toward her, but two Dai Li agents intervene and
                pull up a section of the floor, making a wall. They shoot some rock gloves at Zuko's
                feet, making him lose his balance. He puts his right hand down, but another rock
                glove traps that one. Azula turns around smiling and walks away as the agents
                capture him. Scene changes to inside the throne room, where Sokka, Toph, and Aang
                confront Kuei. </description>

        <speaker name="Kuei">Kuei</speaker>
        <speech>Well, she met with the Council of Generals to plan the invasion, and since then, she

        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>See, Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our apartment right now talking

        <speech>
            <description>Bosco lifts up his head from sleeping to look at the three. Scene changes
                to inside the Crystal Catacombs, where Katara is pacing back and forth. She stops
                pacing upon hearing a hole open up above.</description>

            <description>Katara's shocked face becomes an angry one as Zuko sits up, looking back at
                her with surprise, and the hole closes behind him. The scene changes to Toph, Aang,
                and Sokka reaching their house on Appa. The three jump off and run inside to see if
                Katara was in there. Momo runs up to them.</description>

            <description>An intense shot of blue fire attacks them from behind. Aang stops it using
                earthbending, but the impact forces him backward a few steps. The camera zooms back
                toward Azula, the source of the blast, with smoke trailing from her fingertips.
                Katara uses waterbending to stop another attack, then sends a wave crashing toward
                Azula, who vaporizes the water with firebending. The mist from the vaporized water
                allows Azula to jump onto a crystal and firebend two blasts of blue fire. Together,
                Aang and Katara use waterbending to stop the blasts. Azula finishes her jump by
                landing on a rock pillar. Aang uses earthbending on the pillar, and Azula gasps once
                she notices the pillar crumbling. She jumps off and lands between Katara and Aang.
                She points at both of them, preparing to attack or defend herself.</description>
            <description>An orange fire blast lands in the middle of the standoff, and they look to
                see the source of the fire blast to be Zuko. Zuko looks from Azula to Katara and
                Aang, choosing who to attack. When he looks at Azula, she is glaring back at him. He
                then looks at Aang, who gasps once he realizes Zuko will attack him. Zuko firebends
                at him, and Aang uses airbending to jump away from the blast. Azula smiles at this
                and starts dueling with Katara, and Zuko furiously throws multiple fire blasts at
                Aang. The scene changes to Kuei, Sokka, and Toph in a prison cell. Sokka looks out
                the door's barred window.</description>

                crumples and gets thrown away from the doorway.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Cut back to Zuko and Aang fighting. Aang airbends the air currents around
                him to make a human-shaped gust of air at Zuko, knocking him down. Aang attacks Zuko
                with more airbending, but Zuko maneuvers around the attacks and gets back up on his
                feet. He fires more blasts at Aang who is clinging on to a rock pillar. Aang jumps
                onto a clump of crystals to avoid the attack. Furious, Zuko summons a greater blast
                of fire. Aang earthbends some crystals to protect him, but the crystals shatter,
                sending Aang flying to another clump of crystals. Zuko uses fire whips to attack
                Aang once again, but Aang jumps to another patch of crystals and Zuko keeps
                attacking.</description>
            <description>Cut to Azula landing on a puddle of water running toward Katara, who sends
                a aharp wave of water at Azula that very nearly hits her face, but cuts her hair
                instead, startling her. Cut back to Zuko, who is still using his fire whips to
                attack Aang, who is now jumping along the cave's ceiling. Aang kicks down a
                stalactite and follows it, using earthbending to increase its impact and sending
                Zuko flying, bouncing off the ground into a small wall of crystals. The scene
                focuses on Azula and Katara. Katara waterbends at Azula, knocking her down. Azula
                slowly gets back up into a fighting stance as Katara encases herself in water. One
                water tentacle captures Azula's hand as she struggles to attack her, and another one
                captures her foot after another failed attack. Katara then lifts Azula up, who yells
                in fear. Zuko frees his sister using firebending to break the tentacles. Azula gets
                up and briefly smiles at Zuko in gratitude, then looks toward the crater Aang had
                created with the stalactite. Aang crawls out, exhausted. Azula runs toward Aang. Cut
                to Zuko and Katara fighting. Katara still has water whips on her hands and Zuko
                starts using his fire whips.</description>

            <description>Zuko fires another blast. Cut to Azula and Aang standing opposite each
                other. A closer shot of Azula and Aang as they prepare to fight. Azula uses
                firebending to charge at Aang. Aang earthbends crystals around him into a crystal
                encased armor and charges at Azula. Azula stops, and uses her firebending to break
                Aang's crystal armor and send him flying back into an old building. Cut to Mai, Ty
                Lee, and Bosco in the Earth King's throne room.</description>

            <description>The scene changes back to Zuko and Azula both fighting Katara. Hopelessly
                outnumbered, Katara gets knocked down. Aang jumps from the old building and earth
                surfs toward Zuko and Azula to stop them from attacking Katara, with a fiercely
                determined look on his face. However, a Dai Li agent appears and jumps in front of
                Aang's surf, sending him flying off. Aang yells as he falls. More Dai Li agents
                gather behind Zuko and Azula. Katara starts regaining her focus and Dai Li agents
                surround her. Katara uses the octopus form to defend herself. Aang stands up in a
                fighting stance, but his determined face quickly turns into one of
                despair.</description>

            <description>Closing his eyes, he turns away from Azula and Zuko and earthbends a
                crystal shelter tent. Aang starts meditating. Inside Aang's mind, a giant version of
                himself in the Avatar State, the Avatar Spirit, holds an airbending sphere with a
                normal-sized version of himself in the Avatar State. Back in the crystal shelter,
                Aang enters the Avatar State and the crystal shelter starts glowing, alerting those
                outside. Inside the shelter, Aang opens his glowing eyes and breaks the crystal
                above him. The camera shows Katara looking up to Aang, now rising in to the air,
                with hope. But before Aang can let Katara go and control the Avatar State, a bolt of
                lightning strikes him in the back. Cut to Azula's eyeball watching Aang getting
                struck, before it zooms out to show her smiling menacingly in a lightning summoning
                position with her fingers smoking. The Avatar Spirit lets go of Aang and falls out
                of the plane of existence. As Aang falls down, Katara, tears now falling down her
                face, creates a wave to catch Aang. The wave knocks down the Dai Li agents and Zuko.
                She looks down at Aang's lifeless body and back up with tears in her eyes. Zuko and
                Azula prepare to attack Katara, but a blast of fire stops them. Iroh, the source of
                the blast, jumps down from the wall of the cave and shields Aang and Katara from
                Zuko and Azula.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Katara walks away slowly with Aang's body to a waterfall, and she uses
                waterbending to lift herself and Aang's body up its path. Iroh holds off the Dai Li
                agents, taking blows of earthbending, until after Aang and Katara leave. He submits
                to the Dai Li, who use earthbending to encase him in crystals. Azula is triumphantly
                smirking next to Zuko, both looking at Iroh. Iroh is looking back at Zuko, then
                closes his eyes and turns away. Cut to Bosco, Kuei, Toph, Sokka, Aang, and Katara
                riding on Appa. Appa moans sadly. Cut to a closer shot of Katara placing Aang's body
                on Appa. Katara opens the vial around her neck and uses water healing on Aang's
                wounded back. The rest of Team Avatar, Kuei, and Bosco all look sadly and in
                anticipation. The glowing from the spirit water stops, and Katara starts crying,
                assuming that it was not enough to save Aang. Aang's tattoos glow for a second and
                Aang groans. Katara, overcome with joy that Aang is alive, looks at him, who smiles
                a little, and she holds him closer. Cut to the Earth King's throne room with Azula
                sitting down at the throne with Zuko at her left.</description>
