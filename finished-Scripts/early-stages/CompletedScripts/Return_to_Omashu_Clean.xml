            <description>The episode opens to a bright, blue sky, the sun shining. The camera zooms
                out quickly to reveal a red Fire Nation flag waving in the wind. Cuts to shot of the
                Earth Kingdom city of Omashu having been captured by the Fire Nation. A bold red
                flag bearing the Fire Nation insignia is proudly hung; gray plumes of smoke fill the
                air surrounding the fallen city.</description>

            <description>Scene changes to below Omashu's gate where Aang is attempting to open the
                entrance to a secret tunnel.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Aang opens the tunnel, revealing it to be filled with sewage.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The group proceeds through the tunnel to the inside of Omashu. Aang
                conjures an air ball with his staff to clear the path while Katara uses waterbending
                to maneuver the sewage carefully around her. Sokka, on the other hand, is
                continually soaked in the foul substance.</description>

    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Sokka emerges covered in slime. Katara spots water nearby and splashes
                Sokka with it using waterbending to wash off the sewage followed by Aang who uses
                airbending to dry him off while he screams which reveals that three pentapi have
                attached themselves to his skin.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Quickly tackles Sokka into a wall in order to slience him; in a somewhat

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Sokka looks at the pentapuses in fear. Aang removes the first pentapus by
                lightly rubbing its head as Sokka watches. Sokka rubs the spot where the creature
                was attached, and does the same procedure to get the second one off. Several guards
                suddenly approach them as Aang takes the third one off.</description>

        <speech>You're right. The Royal Procession is dead weight. If I want to catch my prey, I

            friends.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Scene switches to Omashu by twilight, where Aang, Katara and Sokka with
                Momo on his shoulder are sneaking around. They hide behind some metal bars used for
                construction as a patrol passes.</description>

            <description>The foursome goes on. The picture switches to a close-up of a young woman
                with black hair and an emotionless expression named Mai. Behind her walk two Fire
                Nation guards.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>The picture widens as the camera zooms up to show some rocks, ready to be
                pushed down one of Omashu's mail delivery chutes which ends near where Mai's party
                is walking. You can clearly see the light of the torches from up

            <description>Cut to the resistance fighter at the beginning of the chute, who pushes the
                rocks down the chute with earthbending. Aang and his friends walk by and they see
                the rocks crumbling down at high speed. Aang looks in distress at Mai's party. He
                raises his staff and pulverizes the rock with a blast of air as it passes. Mai's
                party is alerted by the sound and looks up to see what caused it. Close-up of Mai
                who squints her eyes to make out who is standing above her before the picture shows
                Aang again. Cut back to the party.</description>

            <description>Close-up of Mai, who is seen for the first time with a faint smile on her
                face. She spreads her arms at Aang, causing tiny arrows to fly toward him. Aang
                quickly jumps up, avoiding the arrows which bury themselves in the stack of
                construction material Aang lands on. Aang, Katara, Sokka and Momo run away as two of
                the Fire Nation guards are climbing up ladders to get to them.</description>
            <p>
                <description>Katara quickly turns around and uses the water from her pouch to form a
                    water whip and send the two guards flying off into the deep. As you see them
                    falling, we see Mai reaching the top. While she is running toward Katara, she
                    stretches out her right hand, shooting off some more arrows. Katara raises a
                    shield of ice to protect herself as the arrows embed themselves in it. Mai keeps
                    charging Katara, who runs away. Mai jumps over the icy wall in hot pursuit of
                    Katara. Aang awaits Katara and lets her pass as he awaits the arrival of Mai.
                    With a spinning sweep of wind, he causes some of the construction scaffolding to
                    collapse. Mai sees the scaffolding collapse and directs a throwing star right at
                    Aang. He twirls his staff in front of him and catches the flying star with it.
                    Mai stands on one side of the collapsed scaffolding and has a clear shot on
                    Aang, Katara, Sokka and Momo. As she throws more arrows at them, the ground
                    beneath the team opens up, making them disappear and rapidly closes again. Mai
                    looks at the place where her targets disappeared, letting out a deep sigh. She
                    turns around and walks away.</description>
            </p>
            <p>
                <description>Cut to a tunnel scene. The image shows the rectangle where the kids
                    fell through. Green sewage waste drips from the ceiling. The camera moves down,
                    revealing a group of people who are looking at the three kids. Aang and Sokka
                    are rubbing their heads, while Katara just sits there a bit disorientated. Cut
                    to a shot of Yung, flanked by two other men.</description>
            </p>
            <p>
                <description>The picture switches to an upside down shot of some grass. When the
                    view pans up, we see mountains, circus tents and some people working in the
                    background. Azula, also upside down, walks in.</description>

            <description>Ty Lee, still smiling, does a back flip and ends up lying on her chest with

    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Azula looks as three men are trying to move a platypus bear. The Bear
                groans and moves up to reveal that it has laid an egg. Azula looks at this in
                disgust and turns her attention back to Ty Lee, grinning once more.</description>

            <description>Cut to Ty Lee who is still lying on the ground, watching the same Platypus
                bear as Azula, but she looks happy to see what has happened. When Azula addresses
                her, she diverts her attention away from the bear and looks at Azula in a wondering
                gaze.</description>

            <description>Ty Lee's accidentally breaks her stance, as she gasps in panic. She

            <description>Cut back to Omashu, where a lot of people have gathered in some sort of
                underground cave. At the other side of the room, Aang, Sokka, and Katara enter the
                large space through a tunnel; they are talking to three other men.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Cut to a close-up of Yung who angrily balls his fist as he answers Aang's

        <speaker name="Yung">Yung</speaker>
        <speech>Of course not! The day of the invasion, we readied ourselves for battle. We were
            prepared to defend our city ... to fight for our lives and for our freedom. But before
            we even had a chance, King Bumi surrendered.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The camera moves slowly toward Aang, who is clearly disconcerted by the
                news. Katara gives Aang a look of concern.</description>

        <speech>The day of the invasion, I asked King Bumi what he wanted to do. <charAction>Cut to

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>A flashback shows the day Omashu was under attack. King Bumi and Yung stand
                atop one of the city's walls, looking down while fire balls decorate the
                sky.</description>

    <p>

            <description>The flashback fades away to make room for another close-up of

    <p>
        <speaker name="Yung">Yung</speaker>
        <speech>It doesn't matter now. <charAction>Cut to Aang who sadly lowers his eyes as the
                resistance leader continues.</charAction> Fighting the Fire Nation is the only path
            to freedom. <charAction>Switch to a close-up of Yung again.</charAction> And freedom is

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>As Yung ends his speech, a smile plays on his face. Aang sadly leans on his
                staff. He raises his eyes as while he addresses Yung.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Actually there's another path to freedom. You could leave Omashu. You're directing
            all your energy to fight the Fire Nation. <charAction>The camera pans to the right,
                showing several Earth Kingdom soldiers.</charAction> But you're outnumbered. You
            can't win. Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day.</speech>

        <speech>You don't understand. They've taken our home, and we have to fight them at any cost!

        <speech>
            <description>Yung looks at all the people who have taken refuge under ground and now are
                living in the sewer tunnels while they whisper among themselves. He looks back at
                Aang.</description>

        <speaker name="Yung">Yung</speaker>
        <speech>Fine. But there's thousands of citizens that need to leave. How're we going to get

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Switch to Sokka whose hand is on his chin as he is cooking up a plan. He
                points at Yung as he exclaims his idea.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Katara raises one eyebrow and just stares at Sokka. The rest of the group
                follows her example. Momo chirps questionably. Sokka blinks, shifting his eyes right
                and left, smiling broadly.</description>

        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut to a shot of a bucket of water filled with pentapi. A hand reaches in
                and takes one out. The civilian, whose face is already covered with the marks of
                removed pentapi, places it on his exposed left arm. Its jellylike body moves up and
                down a bit. After a few seconds, someone else removes the pentapus by gently rubbing
                its head. We see several shots of people placing and removing pentapi from their
                face, shoulders and arms.</description>
            <p>
                <description>Switch to a top view of the people as Sokka walks over to them to
                    address them. While he speaks, the camera pans out, showing a close-up of all
                    the inhabitants of Omashu covered with the suction spots of the
                    pentapi.</description>

            <description>An old man hobbles into view, leaning heavily on his cane. He clutches his

            <description>Sokka and the other civilians start walking toward the gates of Omashu.
                Just as Katara wants to join them, she notices that Aang is walking off in the other
                direction.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Momo jumps on Aang's shoulders, tugging Aang's lips. He grabs Momo by his
                neck and places him back on the ground.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Aang uses airbending to propel him unto the air. He whizzes away, jumping
                from one rooftop to the other.</description>
            <p>
                <description>Switch to some Fire Nation soldiers with spears who are guarding the
                    gates of Omashu. A moaning crowd of 'sick' people walks toward them from every
                    direction. They move like zombies, swaying back and forth. One of them even
                    falls down. The guards back away as the sick crowd reaches them. Sokka
                    theatrically grabs his face and moans painfully, before stretching out his hands
                    toward the frightened guards.</description>

            <description>The guards on the ground start to retreat into the citadel behind them,
                away from the sick, while another guard rings the gong to alert everyone of the
                problem at hand.</description>
            <p>
                <description>Switch to the governor of Omashu and his family, including Mai, who is
                    eating a bowl of fire flakes, watching on one of his balconies, looking out over
                    the city.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>The guard bows in respect before leaving to spread the governor's orders.

            <description>The governor's family is shown from behind. As his wife hugs her husband,
                the little baby beside her, Mai's brother Tom-Tom toddles away from the
                group.</description>
            <p>
                <description>Switch to Aang running through the streets of the city. He nimbly
                    climbs a house and balances on the railing, before landing on a flat rooftop. He
                    spots a giant, white creature below, sadly pushing forth a turnstile. Aang jumps
                    down to discover that the creature is Flopsie, King Bumi's pet goat
                    gorilla.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>As Aang calls his name, Flopsie turns around and happily tries to reach his
                friend. His chains hold him back, so he sadly ceases his attempts. Aang jumps over
                him and uses the water from his drinking bowl to freeze the lock on his chains. With
                one swing of his staff, Aang destroys the lock, freeing Flopsie. The happy animal
                hugs and licks Aang's face.</description>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Come on, Flopsie. <charAction>He climbs on top of Flopsie.</charAction> You gotta

            ... I guess that doesn't work with you. Let's go!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Flopsie races off at great speed. Meanwhile Momo is soaring through the
                city. He lands on a balcony and peeks through a window. We see a cluttered room with
                dressing panels at the back. A teddy bear is thrown repeatedly in the air by someone
                behind the panels. Momo spots a full scale of berries and starts to drool. He
                quickly enters the chamber through the window and starts to stuff his face. He
                rapidly spits out the seeds. Some of them land behind the panels. Cut to Tom-Tom who
                is playing with the stuffed animal behind the panels. He notices the seeds and
                crawls away, following their path. The trail of seeds leads right back to Momo, who
                is still sitting on the table, his tail dangling over the edge. Tom-Tom sits up in
                wonder as he examines the tail before pulling it. Cut to a surprised Momo who is
                pulled down to the ground in mid bite. He pulls a giggling Tom-Tom along as he tries
                to get away from his grasp. Momo pulls free and jumps out of the window on to the
                railing. As he looks back, he sees that the baby stumbles toward him with his arms
                spread out wide. Momo backs away, leaping of the railing and flying
                away.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The baby is too late to grab Momo, so he tumbles off the railing. While he
                is sliding down the roof, he cannot stop giggling. He lands in a box of berries
                sliding down one of Omashu's chutes. Momo lands on the same box and starts to stuff
                his face again. His eyes open wide as Tom-Tom emerges behind him. The baby grabs
                Momo's tail and bites it. The lemur jumps in the air and frantically flaps his wings
                in an attempt to get away once more. As the slope becomes steeper, Momo is able to
                lift himself as well as Tom-Tom who is still clinging on to his tail. The lemur
                cannot bear the weight and they start to descend. Tom-Tom is being dragged over the
                ground as they crash-land. Tom-Tom rolls over the ground and lands on top of Momo,
                pinning him to the ground, and causing him to screech and shake around
                desperately.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The moaning crowd passes them by, diverting Tom-Tom attention away from
                Momo. Momo escapes into the crowd. The baby pushes himself to his feet and staggers
                after the crowd, out of the gates.</description>

            <description>Cut to the Fire Nation circus at night. Upon entering, performers in two
                Chinese dragon's costumes are dancing. As they move out of the frame, the circus
                master, Shuzumu, stands before the circus' main ring, addressing the

            <description>Cut to a shot of the circus ring. The camera moves up, revealing a net
                spanned under an acrobat who is balancing on a rope, high up in the air on one hand.
                The camera zooms in. The acrobat is Ty Lee, who is wearing very colorful

                the balcony. Her daughter Mai slowly reaches into her robe and pulls out a
                handkerchief and gives it to her mother with a bored expression on her face. The
                governor rests his hands on the railing of the balcony as he stares out over his
                city. His sobbing wife, apathetic daughter and two guards stand behind him. Zoom

            <description>Switch back to an overview shot of the campsite in the valley. The gang,
                the baby, Flopsie and three resistance fighters are sitting at one of the many
                campfires. The baby is still trying to catch Momo. The lemur leaps out of the way
                and the baby tumbles down, right next to Sokka's club. He picks it up and starts to
                suck on it. The camera moves back as Sokka snatches the club out of the baby's

                stairs toward the house of the governor. The silhouette of Azula can be seen through
                the veils. At the base of next stairs, the lonely figure of Mai awaits the arrival
                of the palanquin. Azula gets out and she and Ty Lee walk over to Mai. They halt
                before her. Mai puts her hands together and bows slightly toward

            <description>Cut to a large red flag with the black Fire Nation mark on it. The camera

            <description>He sprints forward with his glider at the ready, increasing his speed with
                airbending. Azula tries to stop him by blocking his path with a mighty stream of
                blue flames. Aang dodges these by leaping high up into the air. Azula is completely
                shocked by this incredible jump. Aang briefly touches the scaffolding around the
                statue and pushes himself off, opening his glider in mid air. While opening his
                glider, he loses his hat, leaving his arrow tattoo exposed. He holds on to the hat
                with his teeth.</description>

            <description>Cut to an overview shot of Sokka and Katara running to the edge of the big
                platform. Before they can reach it, Ty Lee's fist emerges from one of the holes in
                the floor and punches Sokka's foot, causing him to fall over and slide toward the
                edge. He protectively clutches the baby in his arms, preparing for the worst, but
                they stop just in time.</description>
            <p>
                <description>Switch back to Katara, who sees Ty Lee jumping out of the hole in the
                    floor and setting course for Sokka. She bends water from her pouch to attack
                    her, but notices something behind her. Cut to a close-up of Mai, who throws four
                    knives at Katara. Katara reacts by quickly by using her water whip to raise up
                    several wooden planks. A close-up of Katara shows that the wooden board is just
                    in time to prevent the knives from piercing her face. The knives embed
                    themselves in the wood. Katara uses her water whip again to shoot the wooden
                    boards to Mai. She turns around in one fluent motion toward Ty Lee who has
                    almost reached Sokka and the baby by now. The water whip grabs Ty Lee by the
                    ankle, pulling her to the ground. This gives Sokka the time he needs to get up
                    and head for a nearby ladder. He slides down and starts his descend of the
                    scaffolding.</description>

                a plume of blue fire toward Aang with a powerful kick. Aang startles by her sudden
                appearance and swift attack. He deflects the flame with a strong air current of his
                own.</description>

            <description>While Aang is still smiling, he notices the fast approach of something in a
                chute on his left. He turns to see what it is, just as Azula shoots several fire
                missiles toward them. He spins his staff above his head to deflect them. Both chutes
                come together and Azula is now behind them. Aang directs a gust at her, but she
                parts it with her hands clasped together in front of her. She retaliates with
                several fire blasts. Aang ducks underneath them and starts to peddle with his staff,
                increasing their speed. They enter a portion of the chute that has wooden arches
                over it at short intervals. Aang cuts these through with an air blade, making them
                collapse upon the track. Azula is caught in the dust cloud, knocked up by the
                falling debris. When her box emerges again, it seems to be empty. Aang does not see
                Azula anymore and sighs in relief, but his sigh quickly turns into a scream as Azula
                emerges again from the box, sending another beam of fire toward him. Aang drops flat
                on his belly to avoid it. Cut back to the large wooden platform where Mai and Katara
                are still fighting. Mai dodges Katara's water whips and answers her attacks by
                shooting stiletto's out of the launcher attached to her leg. Katara easily defends
                herself by freezing the water to create an ice wall. Mai uses this time to charge
                Katara head on. The waterbender defends herself by capturing Mai's right arm in a
                stream of water and freezing it. Mai tries to break the ice, but fails. Ty Lee
                climbs on the platform behind Katara. She bounces toward Katara and hits her with
                several quick jabs on her arms. Katara is surprised by this attack and loses control
                over her water stream that splashes on the ground. She tries to raise the water
                again, but it only moves a little.</description>

                    fire at Aang. He spins his staff around in defense while they are still

            <description>Appa swerves to avoid another blue fire blast. As he pulls closer again,
                Aang lifts up the coffin by hitting the side of the chute. Katara and Sokka try to
                grab hold of the coffin as it passes overhead, but they cannot reach it. Bumi
                screams as he and Aang fall down. Aang moves the coffin to a more horizontal
                position in midair. Their fall is broken by another chute as they land crosswise on
                it, breaking right through. They land on another chute and start to slide down once
                again with Azula on their trail.</description>

                <description>Switch to Azula who creates a whirling disk of flames and sends it down
                    the chute. It rapidly gains on Aang and Bumi. Bumi peeks at the upcoming fire
                    disk and clenches his teeth in effort. A pillar of earth rises in the middle of
                    the chute, protecting them from the disk. Azula gasps for air as she notices
                    that her path is blocked. She jumps up in the nick of time and slides down the
                    chute on foot, while her box slams to pieces against the rock. She eventually
                    halts in the middle of the chute, looking displeased at Aang and Bumi who
                    continue their descent.</description>
