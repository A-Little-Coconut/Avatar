        <speech><charAction>Voice-over.</charAction> I was arrogant, proud, and boastful ... I never

            sister tribes would come together as one. <charAction>Cut to Kuruk standing amid three
                women and looking past them.</charAction> It was love at first sight.
                <charAction>Cut to Ummi.</charAction> Her name was Ummi. She was from the Southern
            Tribe. And she was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. <charAction>Cut to Ummi and

        <speech><charAction>Voice-over.</charAction> She didn't drown. She disappeared into the
            Spirit World ... Koh took her to punish me for my past mistakes. <charAction>Cut to Aang
                and Kuruk in the Spirit World.</charAction> Every year, on the anniversary of our

        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Hello? Avatar Yangchen? Anyone here?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Yangchen">Yangchen</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Fades in front of Aang.</charAction> It's an honor to meet you,
            Aang.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>It's been such an amazing experience to meet my past lives.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Yangchen">Yangchen</speaker>
        <speech>And what did you learn by meeting them?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Well ... I realized that no Avatar is perfect. They all struggled and made mistakes.
            Like me.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Yangchen">Yangchen</speaker>
        <speech>Very wise.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>But it made me wonder - why is the Avatar Spirit a human in every life? Wouldn't it
            be better if the Avatar was an all powerful spirit that never died?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Yangchen">Yangchen</speaker>
        <speech>I don't think so. <charAction>Katara, Sokka, Toph, Iroh, and Zuko fade onto the
                camera.</charAction> The Avatar must be compassionate towards all people ... and the
            only way to do that is to live with them. <charAction>Fade to a sand sailer dragging
                Appa away.</charAction> The Avatar must experience sadness ... <charAction>Camera
                pans to show Aang with tears rolling down his face. Cut to Aang in the Avatar State
                in the crystal catacombs.</charAction> Anger ... <charAction>Cut to Aang and Katara
                penguin sledding.</charAction> Joy ... <charAction>Cut to Team Avatar reuniting with
                Appa.</charAction> and happiness. <charAction>Cut to Yangchen.</charAction> By
            feeling all these emotions, it helps you understand how precious human life is ... so
            you will do anything to protect it. If you were an all powerful spirit living on the top
            of some mountain, you wouldn't have much in common with an ordinary person. So the
            Avatar continues to take human rebirth. <charAction>Kuruk, Kyoshi, and Roku appear
                behind her.</charAction> And with each life, learns what it means to be
            human.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Now that I've reconnected with all of you, does that mean the Avatar Spirit is
            okay?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Yangchen">Yangchen</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>The three Avatar spirits behind Yangchen fade away.</charAction> Yes,
            but your physical body is still injured. You need time to heal. <charAction>Puts her
                hand on Aang's forehead tattoo and both of their Air Nomad tattoos
                glow.</charAction> And unfortunately, it seems your ability to enter the Avatar
            State has been disrupted. You won't be able to rely on your past lives to help you. You
            must rely on your friends. And when you wake up, you won't remember this journey to the
            Spirit World. It will be like a forgotten dream. <charAction>Fading away.</charAction>
            Until we meet again, Aang.</speech>
