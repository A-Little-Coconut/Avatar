            <description>The episode begins at Ozai's home on Ember Island. Cut to overhead shot of
                a courtyard where Aang and Zuko practice firebending using synchronized fire blasts.
                Cut to ground-level shot of the two as they create sweeping arcs of fire that
                dissipate into the ground. They each raise an arm and leg, sending forth streams of
                fire, before leaning forward and sending forth another stream of fire. Cut to closer
                shot of Aang and Zuko as they stand upright, assuming a final fighting stance before
                closing their eyes, relaxing their postures, and taking a deep breath. Toph and
                Katara are seen in the background, sitting on steps nearby. Zuko and Aang bow to one
                another, and the latter stretches his arms and walks away. Cut to Katara and Toph,
                who is lying down on the ground, relaxing.</description>

            <description>Fade to nighttime at the theater. Cut to inside the theater to show the

                Aang arrive, with Aang wearing a hat to cover his head tattoos. Toph and Katara sit
                down; Zuko sits next to Katara as Aang tries to sit next to her. Aang stands back

            <description>The curtain rises to reveal a set representative of the South Pole seas.
                Actress Katara and Actor Sokka are rowing their boat along. Cut to Katara who looks
                thrilled to see herself onstage, and Sokka grabs her shoulder, pointing at her,
                himself, and the stage excitedly. Cut to shot of Actress Katara, an older, more
                robust woman wearing Water Tribe garments.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut to Actress Katara still slumped over the side of the canoe. An
                iridescent light suddenly appears from above and she turns her head upward, shocked.
                Cut to shot of the stage where a model iceberg can be seen, the vague shadow of a
                figure visible from behind. The two actors stand up in the canoe.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Cut to Aang who smiles and leans forward in his seat. Cut to close-up of
                the model iceberg where Actress Katara stands before the silhouetted figure, Actor

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>She performs a karate chop, mimicking waterbending. The silhouette
                disappears from view and the prop splits in half, sending forth a jet of steam. An
                actress, meant to portray Aang, leaps up on screen and poses, winking and with one
                hand on hip. The actress is visibly wearing a flesh-colored cap over her hair to
                portray herself as bald; the cap also bears the airbending mastery tattoo. She wears
                an excessive amount of blush on her cheeks and her overall physiognomy and demeanor
                clearly display her femininity.</description>
            <description>Cut to shot of the actual Aang who momentarily closes his eyes and cringes
                in disbelief before leaning forward over the railing even more, eyes bugging out.

        <speech><charAction>Laughs; in a high-pitched voice.</charAction> I'm the Avatar, silly,
            here to spread joy and fun! <charAction>She leans toward Actress Katara, laying a finger
                on her lips, and also motions toward Actor Sokka before standing upright and
                spreading her arms out in a cheery gesture.</charAction></speech>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>A crude, costumed-version of Appa suddenly bursts up from behind the trio
                of actors; loud festival music previously heard in the episode "Avatar Day" is
                presently played. The replica of Appa sways from side to side before leaping off the
                iceberg prop. Cut to a wide shot of the stage as the three actors wearing the bison
                costume, only their legs visible, land to the right of the stage, run across to the
                left side, and finally behind the iceberg prop.</description>

                emotionally.</charAction> that it's making me tearbend! <charAction>Begins to cry
                and grabs on to Actress Aang's leg. Cut to close-up of Actress Katara who continues
                to bawl dramatically. Cut back to shot of the entire trio.</charAction></speech>

                to actual Aang whose head and arm rest lazily on the railing,
                unimpressed.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut back to shot of the trio, Actress Aang now sitting down, her legs
                dangling over the edge of the iceberg prop. Both Actress Katara and Actor Sokka are
                kneeling down.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Actress Aang">Actress Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Laughs and swings arm jovially.</charAction> Did I mention that I'm an

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut to stage where the trio of actors and iceberg prop are no longer
                present; the scene continues to depict the South Pole seas. A model Fire Nation ship
                prop glides onto stage from the left; a man portraying Prince Zuko stands at the bow
                of the ship, garbed in Zuko's outfit from Book One and peering through a telescope.

            that, <charAction>Actor Zuko looks at him, annoyed.</charAction> maybe I'll capture
            another slice. <charAction>He holds the cake up higher before bringing it toward his
                face and proceeding to gobble it down ravenously and noisily.</charAction></speech>

                Actor Ozai makes her back away using his red streamers. Actress Aang jumps over
                Actor Ozai, who fires a constant stream of red streamers at her. When Actress Aang
                lands, Actor Ozai sends a large red sheet painted as fire at her. A black clad
