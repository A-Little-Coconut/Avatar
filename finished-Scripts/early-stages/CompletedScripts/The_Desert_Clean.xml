            <description>The camera shows a wide-view of the desert. Team Avatar looks in every
                direction over the vast ocean of sand for Appa. The camera halts as Aang and Toph
                come into view. Aang turns around to face Toph angrily.</description>

            <description>Cut to a view from the sky, showing Aang flying away from the rest of the
                group who stand by the large crater created by the disappeared library. Cut back to

            <description>Cut to Zuko and Iroh riding on their ostrich horse. Iroh fake-moans in

            <description>Switch to a front view of Zuko and Iroh. Iroh theatrically lets out several
                more groans of pain. Zuko pull at the reins, annoyed by the performance displayed by
                his uncle. As they dismount, the ostrich horse is alarmed by something. Zuko
                immediately takes on a firebending form, ready to defend himself.</description>

            <description>The Rough Rhinos ride through the thicket at both sides of the road Zuko
                and Iroh were traveling on. Mongke's rhino steps the ground forcefully breaking the
                surface. Mongke is shown, pulling back the reigns. Zuko keeps up his defensive
                position, looking at the men that surrounded them. Iroh's face clears up as he
                stands up and places a hand on Zuko's shoulder.</description>

        <speech>Sure. Colonel Mongke and the Rough Rhinos are legendary. Each one is a different

            <description>Camera shows an overhead view of the situation. Cut to Ogodei swinging his
                ball and chain at Iroh, who kicks it away. The chain wraps itself around the leg of
                Kahchi's rhino. Iroh tumbles over the ground, dodging two fire blasts. He rises back
                up and hits the rhino in the rear, making it dash away, yanking Ogodei off his rhino
                and dragging him along. Iroh waves goodbye as he watches them go.</description>
            <description>Vachir shoots a lit arrow at Zuko. He quickly reacts by knocking the arrow
                away and releasing a fire blast, burning a hole in the surprised archer's
                bow.</description>
            <description>Mongke joins the fight by directing some fire blasts at Iroh. Iroh deflects
                each and every one of them. As Mongke is busy with Iroh, Zuko runs up and jumps on
                the back of the Rhino. With two spinning fire kicks, he sends Colonel Mongke
                flying.</description>
            <description>Iroh runs up to the ostrich horse, jumps on and rides toward Zuko, who
                awaits him, standing on the Rhino of Colonel Mongke. As he jumps on, Yeh-Lu
                immediately starts the pursuit. He throws a grenade at the fleeing ostrich horse. It
                explodes right in front of it, but Iroh and Zuko ride through the explosion's
                smoke.</description>

            <description>Cut to Katara, Sokka and Toph, all exhausted and dehydrated, still
                wandering through the desert. Sokka stops to take Momo off his back and use his
                wings to create some shade, causing Toph to crash into him.</description>

            <description>An irritated Toph places her hand on Sokka's face and pushes him to the

        <speech>
            <description>Katara bends three small blobs of water out of her pouch and into the
                mouths of Sokka, Toph and Momo. Sokka circulates the water in his mouth before

            <description>Momo lets out a sad cry in protest of the water's flavor, after also
                smacking his lips. Katara sadly puts the cork back on her water sack.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Katara looks in the direction Sokka's pointing. He walks over to the cactus
                and cuts off a piece with his machete. He happily drinks the fluid that's inside
                while Momo crawls over to him.</description>

            <description>She drags Toph along on her arm as she runs toward Sokka. He and Momo are
                quenching their thirst with plenty of cactus juice. He cuts open another part of the

            <description>He gives Katara a big smile like a true salesman. Cut to close-up of his
                left eye as his pupil dilates rapidly. He tries to shake off the feeling by rapidly
                shaking his head. He starts to trip.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Katara gives Sokka a very weird look. She grabs his cactus juice and pours

            <description>Katara wants to react on Sokka's comment, but is distracted by a sound in
                the sky. She looks up to see Momo flying around in circles, increasing his speed,
                before plummeting into the ground, head first. Katara picks up and cradles the
                unconscious animal.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Katara leads Toph away. Sokka stays behind, staring blankly at the sky.
                Katara retraces her steps and pulls Sokka along by his arms. Cut to an overview shot
                of the endless desert.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Katara sighs as the scene cuts to Aang flying over the desert in search of

    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The camera circles around Aang. While he stares across the horizon, it
                begins to dawn on him that he is not going to find his friend out here. The tears
                well up in his eyes.</description>

            <description>Overcome by anger, he slams his staff on the ground, creating a large
                mushroom-shaped cloud of sand. Dust that was kicked up by Aang's blow washes over
                Katara, Sokka and Toph as they climb over another dune.</description>

            <description>Cut to Katara, Toph and Sokka. It is nearly twilight and they are still
                walking in a single file through the desert. A shadow passes over their heads and
                Aang lands behind them, kicking up a small cloud of sand. As the sand clears, Aang
                is still down.</description>

            <description>Katara directs her gaze to the sky and sees four buzzard wasps circling
                above their heads. She looks at every other member in the team. Aang still sits down
                sulking and Toph staggers a bit. Sokka sniggers a bit while Momo lazily claws at the
                buzzard wasps.</description>

            <description>She takes one more look at the buzzard wasps in the sky before pulling Aang
                along by his staff. Aang holds on to Toph's hand and she holds on to Sokka's in
                turn. A big grinning Sokka pulls Momo along by his tail, who lazily tries to fly in
                the other direction.</description>
            <description>The sun is setting as they all stagger up a large dune, with Katara still

    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>She turns around and sighs at the sight of the rest of the group. They are
                all lying there, exhausted from the long walk and their grief for the loss of

                and Yu, who are sitting on a bench at the other side of the tavern. Xin Fu jumps up
                with the intention to grab them, but Yu places a hand on his shoulder to restrain
                him.</description>

                man quickly place their tiles on the board. Zuko sits down and watches intently as
                the two man place one tile after the other. When they are done, their tiles form the
                shape of a lotus flower.</description>

            <description>Camera shows a close-up of a grinning Xin Fu. As he moves toward Zuko and
                Iroh, two men jump in front of him to block his path. With a reverse roundhouse
                kick, the earthbender bends a rock from the ground and easily pushes them out of his
                way.</description>
            <description>Yu readies himself for battle. He sinks the first person to charge him into
                the ground. Meanwhile Xin Fu kicks two sandbenders away while he is lifting another
                one up in the air and holding a fourth one back with his other hand. After he kicks
                another sandbender away, he twists his waist, sending the two men he is holding
                flying. One of them crashes into the wall behind the bar.</description>
            <description>When there is no one left to fight, Xin Fu and Yu realize that their prey
                has escaped during the chaos. Xin Fu growls in frustration and slams his two fists
                on the ground, erecting a giant pillar of earth under a downed sandbender, shooting
                him out of the window and against a palm tree.</description>
            <description>Cut to a scorpion walking over a rock. The camera shows how Momo is patting

            <description>Aang gives Katara an angry look before snatching the offered water pouch
                out of her hands. The group gazes at him as he quickly passes two times over the

                lands and she peeks in.</description>

            <description>Katara looks at her charts once more and leads the group in the chosen

                flat on her face. Aang and Katara are looking at Toph, while Sokka and Momo just
                stand there, staring blankly to the sky. Toph sits up and rubs her right
                foot.</description>

                made of wood. Aang steps forward, suggestively holding up his staff. As soon as
                Katara backs away, Aang swings his staff around, creating a mighty gust of wind,
                revealing a boat of some sort. Katara crawls aboard and examines it.</description>

                Toph and Aang scream as the first buzzard wasp emerges. Aang pulls Toph down as it

            <description>Cut to a shot of the giant rock from a distance, followed by a shot of the

            <description>A second wasp lands on a nearby rock. The moment it touches it, Toph turns
                around to send the wasp flying again, shooting up the rock from underneath

            <description>Another buzzard wasp flies between Sokka and Toph. She hears it fly behind

            <description>Shift to a close-up of Aang. He is still chasing the buzzard wasp that took
                Momo. A grave expression casts shadows on his face. He dives, emerging again
                straight underneath the wasp. As he turns, he directs a strong gust of wind at the
                wasp with a kick of his leg. The gust forces the wasp to release Momo out of its
                clutches. Momo tumbles down, but quickly regains control and begins to soar next to
                Aang. Aang looks from Momo toward the rising sun at the horizon. With an angry
                glare, he notices that the wasp is getting away. Aang glides down, flying close to
                the ground. Using the speed of his descent, he closes his glider and swings his
                staff down. A powerful wall of air splits the sand, racing toward the escaping wasp.
                The animal is hit in mid air, knocking it to the ground. With a dark glare, Aang
                just stares at the downed wasp before walking back in the direction of the giant
                rock. Momo follows him quickly, frightened by this merciless outburst of
                power.</description>
            <description>Cut back to a shot of the giant rock, where buzzard wasps circle around
                Sokka and the rest, who've reached the sand-sailer at the base by now. Katara looks
                over Toph's shoulder, acting as her eyes.</description>

            <description>Toph reacts immediately and shoots a rock at her left. The buzzard wasp
                takes the rock full in the chest, shrieking on impact before tumbling
                down.</description>
            <description>The camera pans out, showing many more wasps hovering in the air. Suddenly,
                gigantic pillars of sand rise from the ground and scare off the swarm. Katara, Sokka
                and Toph lower their arms they had lifted to shield their heads from the sand. As
                the wind blows the dust away, the camera pans to the left, revealing several
                sandbenders. Aang lands before Katara, Sokka and Toph, ready to face the
                sandbenders.</description>
            <description>Cut back to a shot of the flower shop in the desert village, where a

                toward the door. Xin Fu slams the door open with such ferocity that an overhanging

                of the florist.</description>

            <description>The wind around Avatar Aang starts the swirl, as his anger is reaching its
                peak. Sokka pull Toph along with him as he starts to make a break for it, running
                away from his enraged friend.</description>

            <description>Aang drops his staff. The wind around him forms a fast moving sphere,
                knocking up sand high into the sky. As everyone runs away, Katara stays put, staring
                sadly at the ground. The sandstorm engulfs her and Aang completely, obscuring them
                from the sight of the others. They brace themselves as the whirlwind swoops over
                them.</description>
            <description>Aang's air sphere slowly lifts him up in the air, his teeth clenched and
                his hands cramped with rage. Katara grabs his right arm, preventing him from rising
                any further. The terrible face of an outraged Avatar looks down upon her, only to be
                met by Katara's sincere, sad expression. She pulls him back to the ground and
                presses him close against her chest. Sokka and Toph lower their arms as the wind
                becomes less violent. Tears are streaming down the Avatar's glowing eyes. Katara
                tries her best to hold on as her own tears well up. The air sphere slowly dissolves
                away as Aang leaves the Avatar state. His rage subsides to make room for pure,
                heartbreaking sadness.</description>
