            <description>The episode opens with a shot of the incline leading to the Royal Caldera
                city, as the camera pans above to an aerial shot of the city. Shot cuts to the Fire
                Nation Royal Palace, before cutting to Zuko's bedroom, to show Zuko tossing and
                turning in his bed, unable to sleep. He opens his eyes and gets up, donning a cloak.
                Cut to the rim of the volcano, as he walks through a path. Cut to the Capital City
                Prison as Zuko walks toward it. Cut to an overhead shot of him stopping and looking
                above. Cut to a guard walking around a balcony, who spots him.</description>

            <description>Zuko, without speaking a word, turns around and walks away. The guard,
                seeing Zuko leave, resumes his patrol. Scene changes to some islands at day time, as
                a mysterious cloud goes toward one of the islands at an abnormal speed. Cut to the
                cloud "descending" on one of the islands.</description>

            <description>Aang airbends the cloud surrounding Appa as the flying bison lands. Sokka
                jumps to the ground from Appa and reconnoiters, before crossing his arms and looking
                toward Team Avatar.</description>

        <speech>Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind
            of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut. <charAction>He reconnoiters
                again.</charAction></speech>

            chatting up there and turn us in.</speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Turning back toward the other three.</charAction> Hey, we're in enemy
            territory. <charAction>He points above as camera zooms back to show four toucan puffins
                standing on a rock behind him.</charAction> Those are enemy birds.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>One toucan puffin jumps onto Sokka's head and screeches. Cut to the other
                three as they laugh, and walk toward the cave, with Sokka following behind.
                Suddenly, he jumps above them and comes "diving" down. He looks suspicious, as shot
                cuts to an aerial shot of him running into the cave, followed by the rest of the
                group.</description>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out. <charAction>Cut to Aang and
                Katara.</charAction> If we get Fire Nation disguises,
                <charAction>Smiling.</charAction> we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in
            a cave.</speech>

                he continuously evades with ease, much to Hide's frustration. Aang gets behind
                Hide's back and moves to the side to match Hide's movements. Aang knocks back Hide
                by butting him. Hide tries to strike Aang two more times, but Aang slides behind
                Hide through his legs. Hide tries punching Aang two more times and falls down as
                Aang side steps and trips him. The Headmaster arrives, and Hide sniffles as he gets
                up to his knees. He is seen with tears in his eyes as the Headmaster

        <speech>Oh boy. Listen guys, dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of
            self-expression that no one can ever take away from you.</speech>

        <speech>Sure you do, you have for generations! It just so happens that I know several
            classic Fire Nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as the 'Phoenix Flight'.
                <charAction>The students ooh and aah as Aang runs low to the ground.</charAction>
            And, this was the 'Camelephant Strut'.</speech>

        <speech>
            <description>Aang jumps from side to side and does a rolls close to two nearby girls as
                they giggle. Aang finishes the dance with a back flip, landing on one foot. The boys
                stare in awe at Aang. Cut to Toph and Katara, who drink out of ice
                cups.</description>

            <description>Cut back to the cave, where Aang is still dancing, spinning through the
                air. Aang offers his hand to On Ji, who blushes and accepts. He pulls her to the

            <description>One student dances crazily. Another student, standing amid a group of
                non-dancers, starts moving his arms and Shoji sways his head with the rhythm. Aang
                runs over to Katara and holds his hand out to her, inviting her to
                dance.</description>

            <description>He pulls her out into the room and whispers into her ear, and everybody
                stops to stare at them as the two extend their arms to each other and begin circling
                each other and performing dance moves.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Katara blushes as they began to move around each other in an elaborate
                dance. The dance incorporates different moves including kicks and flips. At one
                point they come close together as if they are about to kiss, both just smile and
                continue on. Aang finishes the dance by catching Katara as she leans over his arm.
                Cut to a close-up view of them smiling at each other as they pant and sweat. The
                camera cuts to show the Headmaster and several soldiers coming to the
                cave.</description>

            <description>The Headmaster points toward the back of the cave, Hide imitating him. Cut
                to two soldiers who continue searching. One soldier sees another kid with a
                headband, and turns her around. He is again confused upon seeing her

                escapes through the back of the cave. Shoji winks at Aang, who bows in return. Aang
                leaves and earthbends the back of the cave shut, at which Shoji drops his jaw in
