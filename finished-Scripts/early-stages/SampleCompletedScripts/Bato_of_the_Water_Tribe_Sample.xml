            <description>The episode opens up to a body of water, waves crashing against the rocks.
                The camera cuts to grass and sticks, before slowly panning up to reveal a whale
                tooth scimitar standing upright in the ground. Aang's hand comes into view as he
                grasps the weapon's hilt and yanks it out of the ground. Cut to a shot of him
                holding it up while Sokka slides down a dirt slope.</description>

        <speech>Hey, look! <charAction>Examines the sword.</charAction> A sword made out of a
            whale's tooth.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>While Aang draws the weapon free from the ground, Sokka slides down the
                slope and pulls up behind the Avatar, snatching the weapon from his hands as Aang
                turned to show it to him.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Sokka walks on for a little while, before he stops, not too far from Aang,
                to study the weapon closely. Cut to a shot of the scimitar in his hand. The scene
                switches into a flashback; Southern Water Tribe warriors are preparing their ships,
                loading them with supplies. The camera pans to the left as a warrior walks past,
                carrying a bundle, revealing that a younger Sokka is observing them, his back to the
                camera. Cuts to frontal shot of him as he looks at the scene wistfully, cradling his
                battle club. Flashback fades to present-day, where Sokka bears the same wistful
                expression while holding the whale's tooth scimitar in the same way as his
                club.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cuts to shot of Aang and Sokka searching the wooded area for more weapons.
                Katara walks toward them, curious.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut to shot of a spearhead lying on the ground beneath a few fallen leaves.
                Sokka kneels before it, brushes aside the debris and picks up the spearhead,
                examining it and running his fingers along its point, noticing ash on
                it.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>It's burned. <charAction>Cut to shot of a tree trunk, scorch marks and sharp cuts
                running across its bark. Cut to shot of Sokka and the others.</charAction> There was
            a battle! Water Tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders. <charAction>He turns
                away from the tree and looking down the slope of the hill seeing a black spot on the
                ground.</charAction> The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down
            this hill.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut to shot of Sokka racing down the hill along a dirt path, the camera
                panning downward. He leaps over a few large rocks in his way and continues forward.
                Cuts to shot of a sandy beach. Sokka appears on screen followed closely by Aang and
                Katara.</description>

                sitting idly on the shore.</charAction></speech>

        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>No, but it's from his fleet. <charAction>Strokes the boat off, while Aang appears

        <speech>
            <description>The scene changes to a close-up of Iroh sipping a cup of tea, with a
                relaxed expression on his face.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Exhaling.</charAction> Aahh! <charAction>Cuts to shot of entire room
                where he and Zuko are seated at a low-lying table.</charAction> See Prince Zuko, a
            moment of quiet is good for your mental well-being. <charAction>Pours Zuko a cup of
                tea.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Zuko raises the cup to take a sip, but the ship suddenly jerks; the
                vibrations cause the tea in the cup to go flying, soaking Zuko's face and hair. Zuko
                grunts in frustration, pushes his ponytail back, and rises to see what the commotion
                is about. Cut to the deck of the ship, several firebenders stand poised, ready to
                attack. A large beast, called a shirshu, suddenly leaps onto the deck, a young woman
                mounted on its back. The firebenders flee from the beast. Cuts to closer-up shot of
                the woman, who slows down the beast's progress.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cuts to shot of Nyla, the shirshu, who tears off a chunk of the metal deck
                flooring and hurls it in Zuko's direction. Alarmed, the prince ducks for cover, the
                firebenders and Iroh move to the side, and the metal piece hits the doorway leading
                to the main compartments of the ship with a clang as they turn around to watch it
                hit the door. Zuko looks on in frustration while the firebenders and Iroh take a
                firebending stance.</description>
            <description>Cut to shot of the interior of the ship, a gaping hole present where the
                metal flooring once was. Nyla sticks his head inside and begins sniffing around. Cut
                to shot from his point of view, the scenery slightly warped and in black-and-white
                to reflect how he envisions things. A stream of green is visible, drifting through
                the air. The camera pans right and left as the beast surveys the entire room. It
                focuses on a single barrel which topples over, revealing that a strange man has been
                hiding in there. Cut to a shot above the deck where Nyla raises his head out of the
                hole. The stowaway appears, dashing away from the scene. Nyla shoots forward in hot
                pursuit of him. Cut to side-view of the man trying to flee; Nyla appears on-camera
                and lashes out his elongated tongue. Close-up of the tongue striking the man who
                falls onto the deck, paralyzed, and with a terrified look on his face.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Prepares to mount Nyla, the stowaway already slung onto his

        <speaker name="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>
        <speech>Well, I'm impressed. <charAction>June cracks her whip. Cuts to shot of the shirshu
                bolting off the ship and racing down the dock.</charAction>
            <description>Very</description> impressed. <charAction>Leaning over the ledge of the
                ship with Zuko, stroking his beard thoughtfully; Zuko look at him,
                disgusted.</charAction></speech>

        <speech>
            <description>The scene changes to that night, the camera panning downward to show that
                Team Avatar has settled down for the night beside the Water Tribe ship. Cut to shot
                of Appa. Aang and Momo are lying on his right paw, all three fast asleep. The camera
                pans left, showing Katara having also drifted off in her sleeping bag. Sokka remains
                awake, poking a stick into a blazing campfire, looking worried. Cut to side-shot of
                him; the scene fades to the flashback seen earlier. A younger Sokka is seen walking
                by, carrying a large bundle in his arms, wearing face-paint. Cut to a shot of Hakoda
                standing beside a ship, having handed a bundle to a man in the ship. He turns and
                walks forward. Cut to a shot of Sokka who has halted in his tracks, his father
                approaching him and standing before his son.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>The scene fades back to present day, Sokka still looking sullenly into the
                fire. Suddenly a strange noise can be heard, its source originating from somewhere
                off-camera.</description>

                overhead shot of the shore, the campsite in the distance, as the group begins
                walking away. The scene cuts to a different location altogether, the moon hanging in

                each other. In the background, two nuns drag Sokka and Katara to the side of the
                abbey. Shot changes from Zuko to Aang to Zuko. Zuko firebends a blast at Aang, who
                stops it by waving his glider. Aang sends a blast of air at Zuko, who sidesteps it
                and sends a fire blast at Aang, who spins his staff to stop the blast. Aang sends an
                airbending blast at Zuko, who sidesteps it and sends another fire blast at Aang.
                Aang jumps to avoid the blast. Zuko moves in closer to Aang and sends two fire
                blasts at Aang's head and feet. Aang throws his staff and both jump and duck at the
                blasts. Zuko punches and kicks at Aang, sending fire blasts at him. Aang avoids
                these blasts and sends an air blast at Zuko's head. Zuko ducks and sends more fire
                blasts at Aang. Zuko and Aang both firebend and airbend, respectively, at each other
                at the same time, creating large explosion that forms a mushroom cloud. The shot
                changes to show Zuko and Aang fall on different roofs. Cut to Nyla and June lying on
                the ground. Iroh runs up to June and puts his hand on her cheek. June wakes up and

                with June riding him. Cut to Appa's paw as Nyla lashes his tongue at it. Appa lands
                and falls down, paralyzed. Cut to a shot of June looking at Appa, who opens his eyes
                and slowly gets back up to his feet and growls. Nyla growls back and they charge at
                each other when June cracks her whip. The collision between the two beasts sends
                June flying over Appa, and she takes the opportunity to whip the sky bison. She
                lands on the ground and quickly rolls to the side before Appa stomps on the ground
                behind him where June had landed, cracking the floor.</description>
            <description>Cut to Aang on the roof as he lifts his head and groans and gasps. Cut to
                Zuko running across the roof and sending a fire blast at the camera. Aang jumps into
                the air. Zuko sends a fire blast at Aang's feet. Aang jumps up and sends an
                airbending blast at Zuko. When Aang lands, Zuko sends a fire blast at him. Aang uses
                an air shield to stop it. Aang gets up and sends a stream of air at Zuko, sending
                him to an abbey corner tower. Aang runs toward Zuko and attacks him with an air
                blast. Zuko jumps off the roof and Nyla jumps on. As Aang runs away from the
                shirshu, Appa uses his tail to send an airbending blast at the roof. Cut to Sokka
                and Katara sitting by a wall.</description>

            <description>Cut to Aang jumping in the abbey courtyard stream and Nyla follows him. Cut
                to June and Nyla on the roof. They run to the side as a part of the abbey roof
                explodes. The dust clears to show Appa. Cut to Iroh examining some perfume bottles.
                He sniffs one and sneaks it into his sleeves. Cut to Aang standing by a well. Zuko
                sends him three firebending blasts. Aang jumps to the other side of the well to
                dodge them. Zuko sends another fire blast at him. Aang ducks and notices Zuko is
                carrying Katara's necklace.</description>

            <description>Aang jumps between the four beams of the well. He dodges Zuko's fire blasts
                by moving on all sides of the well. Zuko breaks two of the well's beams and sends
                the wooden structure away. Zuko jumps on the well's circular stone structure to join
                Aang. Zuko sends two fire blasts at Aang, who dodges them by stepping around the
                well. Aang sends two air blasts at Zuko. The shot focuses on well as the two
                opponents walk on top of the well. Aang snatches at Katara's stole necklace, but
                misses. Zuko lunges at Aang, who jumps onto his back. Cut to a shot of Aang flying
                through the air as he grabs Katara's necklace off his foot. Aang lands in the well.
                Zuko sends a fire blast down the well. The water from the well rises out and sends
                Zuko flying. Aang jumps out with the water, which rains a little before Zuko falls
                down. Zuko stands up.</description>
            <description>Cut to Appa, who walks toward Zuko. Nyla's tongue lashes out at Appa from
                off-camera. Appa growls and the shot changes to show June riding Nyla. June cracks
                her whip and Nyla's tongue lashes out at Appa again. Appa falls down and Nyla looks
                toward Sokka and Katara. Mother Superior makes both of them smell a vial of
                perfume.</description>

                and the nuns pour the perfume pots onto the ground. Katara waterbends the perfume
                into the air and pours it on Nyla. The shot changes to show Nyla's point of view as
                the perfume scents cloud his vision of Aang.</description>
