            <description>The episode begins with the gang sitting around a camp site with several
                other groups, listening to a man telling a story of 'airbenders'.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Dramatically; out of view.</charAction> So, travelers. The next time you
            think you hear a strange, large bird talking, take a closer look. It might not be a
            giant parrot, but a flying man. A member of a secret group of air walkers, who laugh at
            gravity, and laugh at those bound to the earth by it!</speech>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Sokka searches inside his heavy cloak, and manages to pull out a bug, a
                worm and a few crumbs.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Aang stands up and runs after the storyteller, who is kneeling in front of
                an old man.</description>

    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The Storyteller shakes his cap behind him as he kneels in front of an old
                man. The shaking causes a coin to come loose and fall from the cap. As Aang searches
                his clothes for some money, Momo picks up the coin and puts it in the cap as the
                Storyteller turns around.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Having given up trying to find a coin.</charAction> It means a lot to
            hear airbender stories. It must have been a hundred years ago your great grandpa met

        <speech><charAction>Confused.</charAction> What are you prattling about, child? Great
            Grandpappy saw the air walkers last week. <charAction>He indicates to the old man he was
                kneeling in front of before. The old man makes a sound in his throat akin to a
                laugh, and waves a greeting to Aang. The shot cuts to Aang, who has a shocked and
                disbelieving expression.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The scene changes from the campsite to a shot of clouds, and Appa flying
                above them.</description>

    <p>

        <speech><charAction>Sitting on Appa's neck, steering. He is talking to Katara and Sokka, who
                are riding in Appa's saddle.</charAction> Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air
            Temple. This is where they had the championships for Sky Bison polo.</speech>

        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Moving to sit at the back of the saddle with her brother.</charAction>
            Do you think we'll really find airbenders?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>He is whittling a piece of wood. The design is
                indecipherable.</charAction> You want me to be like you, or totally honest?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Crossing her arms, obviously angry with him.</charAction> Are you saying
            I'm a liar?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>He shrugs, unconcerned with her mood.</charAction> I'm saying you're an
            optimist. Same thing, basically.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Excitedly.</charAction> Hey, guys, look at this!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The camera moves to show Appa, who is flying toward a mountain with a large
                structure on top. It looks very similar to the Southern Air Temple, with obvious
                spires reminiscent of a temple's architecture. Around them are several dark specks.
                The camera zooms in, and the specks are revealed to be people, flying around the
                temple in plane-shaped contraptions.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Amazed.</charAction> They really are airbenders!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>His face falls as he sees the 'airbenders', and after Katara's excited
                outburst, he leans back and scowls while crossing his arms.</charAction> No, they're
            not.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Exuberantly.</charAction> What do you mean "they're not"? Those guys are
            flying!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Bitterly. He is glaring at the direction of the people flying around the
                temple.</charAction> Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they
            move, they're not airbending. Those people have no spirit.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Suddenly, a boy sitting in an oddly shaped chair flies right above them,
                nearly hitting them, and laughing as he does so.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>I don't know, Aang.<charAction>Katara points to the boy.</charAction> That kid
            seemed pretty spirited. <charAction>Katara indicates to the boy, who is flying
                dangerously close, but still laughing.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The boy begins to fly away, shooting Aang one more look back as he does so
                while grinning. Aang grins devilishly, and opens up his glider to follow the boy. He
                leaves Katara and Sokka on Appa, and they quickly become surrounded by gliders as
                they get closer to the temple. Several gliders almost hit Appa, which causes Katara
                to knock into her brother and shout in pain as Appa moves sharply to avoid
                them.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>We better find some solid ground, before it finds us. <charAction>The siblings land
                Appa on the temple courtyard, out of the hazardous sky. Aang is still flying with
                the boy, and seems to be having fun at the surprise
            competition.</charAction></speech>

        <speaker name="Colonists">Colonists</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Several children are on the ground, cheering on their
                friend.</charAction> Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Teo and Aang do two loop-de-loops as they fly around the air temple. The
                two boys do a spiral downwards.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Teo">Teo</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>The boy doesn't seem upset at Aang, and seems happy that he isn't angry
                for nearly flying into him.</charAction> Hey there, you're pretty good!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Nonchalantly, but with a smirk.</charAction> Yeah, I know. But I can do
            more than fancy gliding.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Aang begins flying closer to the temple, under a bridge. Cut to a scene of
                Aang jumping off his glider and allowing it to fly forward on its own. He begins
                running along a wall, switching to an air scooter halfway, before jumping off onto
                his glider again.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Teo">Teo</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>He is looking amazed, before thinking of his own plan.</charAction> Wow,
            I don't think I can do that. But here's a good one.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Teo turns on a small canister that is positioned under his glider. White
                smoke begins to stream from the strange contraption, and Teo flies around in the
                sky. The camera pans to show the sight from the ground, where it is revealed that he
                has created an image of Aang's face, complete with an annoyed expression. The crowd
                below cheers.</description>
        </speech>

        <speaker name="Teo">Teo</speaker>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Annoyed; his face mimics the one Teo has just drawn.</charAction> It's
            great.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Aang lands beside Katara and Sokka. Teo lands soon after and pulls on the
                brakes. Other children take the glider off of the top of his wheel chair. Teo rolls
                up to Aang.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Teo">Teo</speaker>
        <speech>Hey, you're a real airbender. You must be the Avatar! That's amazing! I-I've heard

    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Sokka ignores all formalities, instead going over to Teo's chair and
                examining the strange shape and design.</charAction> Wow! This glider chair is
            incredible!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Teo">Teo</speaker>
        <speech>You think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my dad designed.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>All four walk inside the building. They enter a room filled with pipes and
                machinery. Aang looks around worriedly. Beneath the pipes, an original mural can be
                seen, although it has been destroyed by the pipes, which are sticking into the
                walls.</description>

        <speaker name="Teo">Teo</speaker>
        <speech>Yeah, my dad is the mastermind behind this whole place. Everything's powered by hot
            air. <charAction>Shows women using an elevator like contraption.</charAction> It even
            pumps hot air currents outside to give us a lift while we're gliding.</speech>
    </p>

        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>

        <speech><charAction>Katara approaches Teo, who seems disappointed at Aang's

            <description>Katara puts her hand on his shoulder. He walks over to a fountain with an
                air bison statue on it. He looks at his reflection in the dirty green water, Aang
                looks at it squeamishly. The sky bison statue suddenly has black smoke coming out of
                it's mouth.</description>

            <description>Screen pans off to show Aang, Katara, Sokka and Teo walking across a bridge
                to a large room that looks well kept. The room has no roof, although around the
                walls there are statues of monks, mostly meditating.</description>

                <charAction>Points finger up.</charAction> but not a hundred years, my people became
            refugees <charAction>Walks behind his son's wheelchair.</charAction> after a terrible
            flood. My infant son, <charAction>Teo looks down sadly.</charAction> Teo, was badly hurt
            and lost his mother. <charAction>Sniffles.</charAction> I needed somewhere to rebuild
            and I stumbled across this place. Couldn't believe it! Everywhere! Pictures of flying
            people! But empty, <charAction>Looks around.</charAction> nobody home. Then,
                <charAction>Does a airplane like gesture, like he's flying up to Aang.</charAction>
            I came across these fan-like contraptions!</speech>

        <speech>Yes! Little, light flying machines! <charAction>Waves his hands up and
                down.</charAction> They gave me an idea. Build a new life for my son, in the air!
            Then everyone will be on equal ground! So to speak. We're just in the process of
            improving upon what's already here. <charAction>Katara wipes her tears on Aang's shirt,
                and Sokka looks like he's holding back tears.</charAction> And, after all, isn't
            that what nature does?</speech>

        <speaker name="Mechanist">Mechanist</speaker>
        <speech>I suppose that's true. Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us.

        <speech>Four flashes. So it's exactly four hours past mid-day. Or, as I call it: four
            o'candle. <charAction>Sokka laughs. Cut to a frontal shot of the mechanist, pleased that
                Sokka is interested.</charAction> If you like that, wait till you see my finger-safe
            knife sharpener. <charAction>He holds up his left hand, revealing that three of the
                fingers are made of wood.</charAction> Only took me three tries to get it right.
                <charAction>He pulls off the three wooden fingers, and throws them into Sokka's

        <speech>I don't know about that. The temple might be different <charAction>Picks up hermit
                crab from the ground.</charAction> but the creatures that live here
                <charAction>Hands it to Katara.</charAction> are probably direct descendants of the

        <speech><charAction>Pokes hermit crab.</charAction> You're right. They're kind of keepers of

            <description>Screen fades slightly and reappears at a long hallway with airbending

    <p>

        <speech><charAction>Confidently, with a matter-of-fact tone.</charAction> Only an airbender
            can open it, so inside it's completely untouched. Just the way the monks left it. I've
            always wondered what it's like in there ...</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>She looks at him, as though slightly scared of his reaction. Her tone is

    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>He turns away from the door and his friends.</charAction> I'm sorry.
            This is the last part of the temple that's the same as it was. I want it to stay that

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Teo">Teo</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Somewhat disappointed, although he tries not to let it

        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>These lanterns are terrible. I can't see! <charAction>Opens the top of his lantern

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Mechanist">Mechanist</speaker>
        <speech>Hey! Close that up! They'll get loose! <charAction>Sokka closes it.</charAction>
            Fireflies are a non-flammable light source. <charAction>Both begin to walk
                again.</charAction></speech>

        <speech>
            <description>They continue for a while until they arrive at a wooden door.</description>

        <speech>Cover your nose <charAction>Both plug their noses.</charAction> and hold your

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Nasally, due to his nose being blocked.</charAction> Okay ... so you
            brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Mechanist">Mechanist</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Closes eye slot.</charAction> Wrong. It's filled to the brim with
            natural gas. Came across it my first time here. Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at
            the time. Nearly blew my self and the whole place even more sky high! Thought my
            eyebrows would never grow back. <charAction>Pans up to his eyebrows.</charAction>
            Anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving. From time to time, we have gas
            leaks. And they're nearly impossible to find.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>So, this place is an explosion waiting to happen.</speech>

        <speech>Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell, or

    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut to a exterior of temple with people flying in the sky. Aang, Katara and

        <speech>The wind will carry you. It supports something inside you. Something even lighter
            than air. <charAction>Shows Katara holding a glider and standing at the edge of a
                building.</charAction> And that something takes over when you fly.
                <charAction>Katara puts down her glider and looks up at the other people
                flying.</charAction></speech>

        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>No! <charAction>Jumps off anyway.</charAction> Aaaaah! <charAction>Starts to fall
                down wards, but eventually starts to fly straight. Her scream peters off as she
                begins laughing.</charAction> I can't believe I'm flying!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Aang and Momo fly up beside her.</description>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>Teo was right about the air. All I had to do was trust it, let it carry me.</speech>

        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one!
                <charAction>Aang lands beside him on the building.</charAction> I've been thinking.
            If you want to see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you.</speech>

            <description>Back to Sokka and the mechanist. The mechanist is drawing on a large piece
                of paper and Sokka is looking through shelves. Sokka drops various things, including
                seven scrolls, four pieces of paper, a hard-boiled egg and a model of a hot air
                balloon.</description>

        <speech>I said don't touch anything! <charAction>Comes over to help Sokka pick things

                the hot air balloon.</charAction> and that egg was just part of last week's

            <description>Aang airbends into the door's contraption, flipping three dials so air

        <speech>Yeah ... <charAction>Both turn toward each other.</charAction> if we put a whole

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Mechanist">Mechanist</speaker>
        <speech>... The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs!</speech>

        <speaker name="Mechanist">Mechanist</speaker>
        <speech>... You smell rotten eggs! Then, you just follow your nose to the place where the

    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>

            the ground! I pleaded with them, I begged them to spare us! They asked what I had to

            <description>Teo looks away in shame and the mechanist leaves. The scene cuts to him in
                his workshop, placing two eggs with smiley faces in his hot air balloon model, along
                with a candle to make it float. He looks rather depressed. He lets go of the bottom
                and it starts to float. As this happens, the door opens, with Aang and Teo standing

        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air-borne,
                <charAction>Places the candle in the model.</charAction> but once it did, it just
            kept going. <charAction>He pulls a string connected to the model, putting it on the
                table.</charAction> You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would
            escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?</speech>
