            <description>The episode opens to morning at the Western Air Temple. Cuts to overhead
                shot of the team's campsite, the camera panning downward slightly, showing their
                sleeping bags all arranged in a circular form. Cuts to overhead shot of Suki and
                Chit Sang sleeping, Chit Sang snoring. The camera pans to the right to reveal Hakoda
                asleep next to Chit Sang. Cuts to ground-level shot of Teo asleep, The Duke and Zuko
                in the background also in a slumber.</description>
            <description>Cuts to shot of Aang asleep on Appa as he wakes up, yawning and rubs his
                eyes. Cuts to shot of the nearby fountain from the view of their campsite, several
                birds fluttering about. The birds suddenly fly away as a bomb is launched their way,
                splashing through the waterfall fountain. Cuts to Aang, who grows suddenly alert,
                before switching to shot of Appa as the Avatar rises and uses his glider to airbend
                the bomb away. Cuts to overhead shot of the temple as the bomb explodes. Two more
                bombs pelt the building. Cuts to campsite, where everyone is now fully
                awake.</description>
            <description>Cuts to shot of Aang, his back to the camera, as he races toward the edge
                of the building, glider in hand. The camera zooms in past his figure to a shot of a
                Fire Nation airship coming into view. Cuts to side-view of the bow of the airship,
                which launches another bomb that sails through the air and crashes into a nearby
                bridge. Cuts to Aang, who runs back to the campsite, Appa following close behind,
                and uses airbending to force the large, ceiling-high metal doors surrounding their
                site to close. Several bombs continue to assail the temple. Cuts to shot of a
                portion of the ceiling roof, as it begins to crumble and finally caves in. Cuts to
                overhead shot of Katara standing directly beneath the crumbling ceiling. She looks
                up, alarmed, only to be pushed out of the way by Zuko.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Cuts to shot of the two as they roll across the floor, the debris from the
                ceiling crashing several feet away from them. They finally settle on the
                ground.</description>

            <description>Katara rushes out from under Zuko and exits off screen.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Cuts to a section of the wall where a hole is bored through. The camera
                zooms out to show Toph and Haru, who have created the exit way using
                earthbending.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Cuts to overhead shot of the tunnel as everyone begins entering the
                passageway. Aang stays behind, trying to get Appa to leave with him by pulling on
                the bison's reins. The camera zooms out, as he spots Zuko standing, facing the
                airships.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Aang, Katara, and Sokka begin pulling on the reins together in an attempt
                to budge Appa. Cuts to shot of the doors of the building, which continue to be
                destroyed. Debris continues to fall to the ground as Zuko races toward the doors and
                leaps over to the other side just as another piece of the door falls and shatters.
                Cuts to shot of Zuko running toward the airships. One bomb is launched and lands
                several feet before him where it detonates. Thick gray plumes of smoke rise; after a
                brief moment, Zuko emerges from the smoke cover, unharmed.</description>
            <description>He firebends a large blast from his hand. Cuts to shot of an airship, as it
                receives the blow. Cuts to shot of Zuko standing near the edge of the temple,
                looking at the airships. A podium-like devise suddenly rises; standing atop it is
                Azula. Cuts to shot of the princess, who has an evil, maniacal grin on her
                face.</description>
        </speech>

        <speech><charAction>Smiling.</charAction> You mean it's not obvious yet? I am about to

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Azula kicks a large blast of flame at her brother. Zuko dodges and runs
                backward into the temple, but falls. Several blasts are sent his way as the temple
                begins to fall apart. He runs toward the airships. As he jumps toward the ship, he
                sends several shots toward Azula, but fails to hit her and jumps onto the airship.
                He falls down into the misty floor below.</description>
            <description>Aang and the group are seen trying to get Appa into the tunnel
                unsuccessfully.</description>

            <description>Katara hesitates before hugging her dad and running back to Aang. Sokka and
                Hakoda hug also as Sokka takes Suki and runs with the others. The two groups go
                their separate ways. Toph is seen touching a wall.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>Appa flies through to the outside of the temple, covered by a shield of
                rock in front. Azula tries to bring him down, only for the shield to absorb the
                blasts. Appa escapes and the shield disintegrates. Behind Azula, a second airship
                rises, revealing Zuko survived his fall by getting onto another
                airship.</description>
            <description>Zuko and Azula face off. Zuko makes the first move. He jumps toward Azula,
                who sends columns of fire at him, which he responds to with more blasts. The two
                attack each other several times.</description>
            <description>Scene changes to Appa, dodging fire blasts, as Katara deflects several
                large whips of fire with her waterbending. The group rises above the airship to
                avoid more fire.</description>
            <description>Back on the airship. Azula and Zuko are evenly matched until they both hit
                each other with fire-packed punches, launching them both off the airship. Zuko is
                caught by Katara, but Azula is left falling.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Zuko">Zuko</speaker>
        <speech>She's ... not gonna make it ... <charAction>Azula uses her firebending to propel
                herself toward the wall, stopping her fall with her hair pin and saving
                herself.</charAction> Of course she did.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cuts to shot of Azula, who stands on the side of the cliff, smiling evilly.
                Cuts to shot of her watching as the team escapes, her back to the camera. The scene
                switches to where the gang is camping outside.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Jokingly.</charAction> If you really want it to feel like old times, I

            <description>Cuts to shot of a waxing gibbous moon, partially obscured by the clouds.
                Cuts to a shot of Katara sitting on a rock and overlooking a rocky cliff, Zuko
                approaching her from behind. She catches sight of him, immediately grows
                antagonistic, and rises to walk farther away toward the cliff.</description>

                heart.</charAction> Remember, back in Ba Sing Se. <charAction>Points to the

        <speech><charAction>Cuts to shot of her and Zuko standing on the cliff as she approaches him
                while snapping at him angrily.</charAction> You really want to know? Hmm, maybe you
            could reconquer Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King. <charAction>Cuts to side-view

            <description>Katara storms away, slightly hitting his left shoulder with her right one
                as she passes Zuko, leaving him disappointed. Cuts to shot of entire cliff side, the
                waves crashing against the rocky wall. The scene switches to the campsite where Zuko
                accidentally runs into Suki on his way to confront Sokka.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Zuko">Zuko</speaker>
        <speech>Your sister. She hates me! And I don't know why, but I do care what she thinks of

    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't hate anyone. Except maybe some people in
            the Fire Nation. <charAction>His eyes widen as he realizes his mistake.</charAction> No,
            I mean, uh, not people who are good, but used to be bad. I mean, bad people. Fire Nation
            people who are still bad, who've never been good and probably won't be, ever!</speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Zuko">Zuko</speaker>
        <speech>Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se, and again
            just now when she was yelling at me. I think somehow she's connected her anger at that
            to her anger at me.</speech>

            <description>A flashback is shown of a younger Katara having a snowball fight with her
                brother. Sokka peers over a snow wall and prepares to throw a snowball at his sister
                only to be hit by a snowball thrown by a younger Katara, off-screen. Cuts to shot of
                Katara, who giggles joyfully. Cuts to shot of Sokka, who climbs over the snow wall,
                carrying an exceptionally large snowball. He drops it, however, upon witnessing
                blackened snow falling from the sky.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Voice-over.</charAction> Many of the warriors had seen the black snow

            <description>Unfortunately for him, Zuko has barely taken two steps away from the tent

            <description>The scene switches to where Zuko and Katara run out from behind a mass of
                large rocks. Using waterbending, Katara creates a raft of ice for her and Zuko to
                ride on to the communication tower. The scene cuts to a corridor of tower where the
                two are crouched in a corner, watching two guards walk out a door. After the guards
                have passed, they stealthily run through the open door. The scene cuts to a female
                guard sitting at a writing desk. The duo peers at her from overhead gratings. Katara
                waterbends the ink onto the guard's hands. She rises from the desk and walks away.
                Katara and Zuko use the time to comb through the files stored in the

            <description>Appa submerges underwater, Katara waterbending an air bubble around his

            <description>He yells as a large water whip emerges from the surface and coils around
                his body, dragging him off the ship. The other soldiers run to the source of the
                incident in shock. Appa surfaces and Katara waterbends two huge waves at the ship.
                The others turn around to see the torrent of water flood the ship, washing them
                overboard. Appa lands on the deck. One soldier, who has managed to stay aboard the
                ship, attacks Katara, who pushes him away with a gush of water. She and Zuko make
                their way through the corridors of the ship, Katara's arms covered in water for
                defense. One soldier bursts from his cabin, a sword in hand only to be attacked and
                locked back inside by Zuko. Katara follows him to a large doorway, where they

                door having been knocked down by the impact of the water. The Southern Raiders
                commander attempts to attack Zuko, who only deflects his firebending

            <description>The camera focuses on Katara using bloodbending on him. With swift motions,
                she forces him to the ground. Zuko looks on at her, momentarily stunned before
                turning his attention back to the commander.</description>

            <description>Katara bloodbends him, fixing him into a position where the Southern
                Raiders commander looks right into her eyes. She gives him a cold, hard stare. The
                camera closes up on one of the commander's eyes before cutting to where Katara's
                face has changed from one of hate to one of shock.</description>

            <description>The camera focuses on Katara, whose eyes are filled with tears. The scene
                changes to a shot of the ground where an anonymous character rakes the soil with a
                trough. Cuts to a side-view shot of a house where a man is tending to his garden.
                The sky is dark and gray with storm clouds. An elderly woman walks up to the open
                door of the house behind him.</description>

                as he walks toward the town's entrance. Cut to some vegetables on display at a
                stall. The scene changes to where Yon Rha is walking to the marketplace of the
                village, the place almost desolate. Yon Rha enters the screen. He begins to buy
                vegetables from a stand. A wind chime tinkles from one of the other stands. Yon Rha
                sharply turns around to view the suspicious activity. The camera view changes to
                someone ducking behind the stand.</description>

            <description>She holds both her arms out, halting the falling raindrops and creating a
                shield above the three of them. After a few moments, she sends a forceful stream of
                water at Yon Rha, transforming the stream into a flurry of ice daggers midway
                through her attack. Yon Rha crouches in fear, preparing to be hit. When he does not
                feel harmed, he looks up to see the ice daggers floating in midair. Katara's
                expression softens and she allows for the daggers to liquefy and drop to the
                ground.</description>

            <description>Katara closes her eyes and lowers her head. Cut to Yon Rha, a hint of a
                smile gracing his lips upon realizing he will be spared. Without saying another
                word, Katara turns around and walks away; Zuko looks from Katara to Yon Rha,
                shooting the latter a last dirty look, and follows her. Yon Rha continues crying and
                shivering in the rain. The scene cuts to a boardwalk overlooking the water. It is
                later that day. Scene cuts to Katara, who is sitting on the edge of the dock, her
                eyes closed, paddling the water with her feet. She opens her eyes sadly as Aang and
                Zuko approach her.</description>
