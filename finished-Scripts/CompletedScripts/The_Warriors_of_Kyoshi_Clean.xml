            <description>The episode opens, depicting a clear, starry night sky, the camera panning
                downwards to the open sea where Zuko's ship sails through the water. Cut to shot of
                inside Zuko's bedroom, the camera panning to the right to portray the entirety of
                the room. Zuko is seen meditating in his cabin, his back to the camera. The glow of
                the four candles situated on a table steadily increases and decreases in time with
                the prince's relaxed inhalations and exhalations. Cut to frontal shot of Zuko
                sitting peacefully with his eyes closed, the four candles in view, continually
                brightening and dimming. Cut to side-view shot of Zuko's head, the door to his cabin
                in view. Iroh cracks open the door and peeks through while Zuko opens his
                eyes.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Cut to shot of the prince sitting motionless, still assuming his
                meditative stance, his back to the camera. Calmly.</charAction> Uncle, you taught me
            that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader. Now, whatever you have to say,

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The flames of the candles suddenly erupt in a fiery mass, brushing the
                ceiling and obscuring Zuko from sight.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut to a wider shot of the room as Zuko rises to his feet, enraged. Iroh
                shields his face from the flames, and merely withdraws a fan from his robe and
                begins waving it to cool himself down.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Desperately.</charAction> How am I going to find him, Uncle?
                <charAction>Cut to a shot of the map in Zuko's hand, several locations marked down
                with zigzagged lines connecting each point; Voice-over.</charAction> He is clearly a
            master of evasive maneuvering.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The shot of his map fades to a shot of the team's own map, minus the

                pants, Aang glancing over at her from atop Appa's head, Momo perched on his

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Using airbending, Aang manages to spin the two marbles quickly along an
                equatorial plane as he grins happily. Cut to side-view of Aang and Katara, Katara
                taking no notice and continues to sew.</description>

                arm breezily at Aang as if he is trying to shoo him away.</charAction> Stop bugging

            <description>Katara angrily tosses the pants in his direction. Cut to shot of Sokka as
                the pair of pants hit him in the face, covering it. He quickly scrambles to free

            <description>Aang yanks Appa's reins to the left, his tongue sticking out of the corner
                of his mouth. Appa picks up speed as he flies right passed the camera. Cut to an

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Appa does not react at all apart from a mild grunt, which comes across less
                than convincing.</description>

        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>

        <speech>

            Yeah, that was <description>real </description>convincing.<charAction>Somewhat

        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Runs toward the shore, takes a sharp breath and points.

            <description>Cut to an overview shot of the bay. Aang is standing on the beach, pointing
                and looking at the water where an elephant koi jumps out the water and back in,
                creating a giant splash. Switch to a shot of the two siblings staring in awe at the

    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut to a side-view of the coastline as Aang runs up and dives in. As soon

            <description>Switch to Katara and Sokka, still standing on shore, they exchange glances
                while Appa walks away, clearly taking interest in something else. Sokka makes a
                circular motion with his left hand around near his left temple, signaling to his
                sister that he thinks Aang is crazy. Cut back to Aang who is swimming toward the
                deep waters of the bay where the koi fish are. He dives under and immediately
                appears again, now holding on to the back fin of one of these giant animals as it
                jumps out of the water before diving again. Cut back to the siblings. Katara smiles
                broadly and impressed at the sight of Aang riding the koi fish while Sokka stares at
                the scene with an uninterested look upon his face and his arms crossed. Cut to a
                broader view, Sokka and Katara are with their back toward the camera. Momo is
                jumping excitedly up and down as Aang's koi fish reappears again.</description>

                excitement as they race through the water. Cut to an overview shot of the bay as the
                three koi playfully jump out the water before diving. Switch to an underwater shot
                of Aang and the fish. Cut to a shot of Katara and Sokka on the beach. Momo is still

        <speech>
            <description>Switch back to a widely smiling Aang atop the fish, presumably in an
                attempt to impress Katara. Switches to off the shore from his perspective as Katara

        <speech>
            <description>Cuts to overhead shot of the water, the backs of the three koi fish in
                view. Two koi fish suddenly change direction, including Aang's, swerving to the
                bottom-right of the screen, leaving behind one koi fish that continues to race
                forward. The camera pans up, the dark shadow of a large body appears beneath the
                water's surface directly behind the koi fish. Switch to a close shot of

            <description>Cut to Aang who grips the dorsal fin of the fish, his smile having now
                faded. He looks surprised at the commotion on the shore. Cut to shot of the shore
                from his perspective, Katara and Sokka motioning for him to exit the water by
                flailing their arms and calling to him from far away.</description>

            <description>Cut to wide-view shot of the lake, the dorsal fin of the creature swerving
                off to the side as Aang uses airbending to run across the surface of the lake at
                lightning speed. Cut to a frontal shot of a heavily panting Aang fleeing the scene,
                his feet treading water, the creature following him in hot pursuit. Cut to overhead
                shot of the lake, Aang a mere speck in the water, a trail of white foam behind him,
                the creature gaining on him. Cut to shot of Sokka and Katara standing on the shore.
                Sokka suddenly grows alarmed as Aang collides straight into him, having reached the
                shore safely. Cut to shot of the entire lake and shore as the dorsal fin of the
                creature disappears beneath the surface. Katara runs to where her brother and Aang
                have come to a halt. Cut to shot of Sokka leaning against a tree trunk, a trail
                marking where his body slid across the ground. Aang is seen dressing himself as
                Katara and Momo approach the two.</description>

            <description>The camera pans upward to where several female warriors clad in green
                kimonos descend from the treetops ambushing the trio. The women quickly encircle the
                group and take them out. Cut to Sokka who is being pulled back and knocked over.
                Switch to a shot of Katara with Aang in the background. Katara is pulled by her arm.
                As she leans in to maintain her balance, someone pulls her parka over her head and
                pulls her down. Aang is distracted by Katara's struggles, giving the opportunity to
                another female warrior to grab him by his collar. Momo flies up screeching from his
                shoulder, only to be quickly caught in a bag, only his head still protruding. Cut to
                a shot of the ground when a bound and blindfolded Momo, Aang, Katara, and Sokka are
                thrown on the ground in a line, each grunting when they hit the ground. They are
                surrounded by the female warriors.</description>

                of the back of a man while the scene pans to the left. The man addresses Aang,
                Sokka, and Katara who are still blindfolded and tied to a large wooden pole. The
                bagged Momo stands on the ground in front of Aang.</description>

                Five girls in green kimonos and wearing white and red face paint are standing in
                front of him. Cut to a side-view shot, panning to the right.</description>

            <description>Switch to Oyaji's point of view as the camera pans up. At the top of the
                wooden pole stands a statue of a tall woman holding two stretched open fans. She is
                dressed in a similar outfit as the female warriors that ambushed the

            <description>Suki and the rest of her warriors immediately retract their metal fans from

                threateningly start to move forward and surround the bound friends. Cut to a close
                shot of Katara as she leans forward in the ropes, glancing to her right where Aang

                warriors, his mouth open in shock and stopping at Aang who looks questioningly at
                Katara for a moment. Cut to an overview shot of the scene as Aang bends over before
                pushing himself off the ground. He leaves a large dust cloud as he shoots in the
                air, stretching out his ropes, using one of the outstretched fans of the statue to
                snap them in half. Now completely free of his bonds, he tumbles elegantly over the
                statue.</description>

        <speech>
            <description>He performs his trick again, letting the marbles spins around really fast
                between his hands. Grinning and blinking like a fool, he looks at the crowd, hoping
                to impress them. Cut to the cheering crowd. A young man in the front starts to emit
                a high pitched squeal while widely tossing his hands up in the air in admiration. He
                gets so overexcited that he starts to foam, fall toward the camera, and faints; the
                rest of the villagers just keep on cheering.</description>
            <description>Cut to a side-view of the harbor of Kyoshi island, where one of the village

                over to a scene in a street where the fisherman delivers the basket to the
                fishmonger while passing on the news of the Avatar's whereabouts. The fishmonger
                turns around and the scene fades away again to another scene where the fishmonger
                sells one of the fish to a servant, dressed in Fire Nation red. He too passes on the
                news. When the servant turns around, the scene fades to inside Zuko's ship where the
                servant is serving the cooked fish at the table of Zuko and Iroh. Cut to a frontal

            <description>Zuko leaves the room under the watchful eye of Iroh. As soon as Zuko is out
                of the screen, Iroh crosses his arms, turns around, and sulks.</description>
            <description>The shot switches to a close-up of Kyoshi's statue's wooden face as it is
                being repainted. The right side of her face is already done and the previous cracks
                are not visible anymore. The painter carefully reapplies her left eyebrow with black
                paint. A back view shot of the statue shows the main street of Kyoshi village with
                houses at both sides and one bigger house at the end of the street. Another villager
                is cleaning the back of the statue with a broom. The camera pans to the right until
                the big house becomes the center of the shot before cutting to a shot of Appa who
                lazily lies on his side, eating hay while two villagers are grooming him. He growls
                and chews while the camera pans the left and up to focus on three open windows of
                the main house on the first floor. Cut to a side-view of inside the house where
                Aang, Katara, and Momo are sitting at a long table. A villager places another dish
                on the already richly filled table. Aang and Momo are very excited to see the
                display of decadent desserts in front of it, but Katara supports an uneasy

                front of her. Cut to a frontal view of the two as a doubtful Katara picks up and
                closely investigates the dessert she just pokes. Aang on the other hand does not
                share her reluctance and starts stuffing his face, two desserts at

            <description>Momo sneaks up to Aang and snatches the dessert out of his other hand and
                quickly dashes away, who smiles at his pet. He does not let the theft bother him and
                quickly gabs another dessert in front of him while Katara munches down the piece of
                cake and reaches across the table for the same dessert Aang just took. Aang glances
                to his left, over the hunched Katara to Sokka. Momo appears between Aang and Katara
                and quickly snatches another cupcake from the table before vanishing underneath

            <description>Cut to a wider shot of the table. Momo is lying underneath the table with

            <description>Front view of Aang and Katara. In the back villagers are still working on

        <speech>
            <description>Aang gets up and leans on the window sill so he can look better outside. As
                soon as he emerges, the villagers scream with delight and admiration for him. Aang
                looks down in surprise to see where the sound came from. The camera switches to his
                point of view and reveals a bunch a little girls cheering for him; Koko is among
                them in the front row. The camera cuts back to Aang who flashes a broad smile at the
                girls while blushing. Katara is standing behind him with her arms crossed in
                disapproval. She rolls her eyes and makes a raspberry.</description>
            <description>The shot changes to a side-view of a brownish-red bridge over a small
                creek. Aang quickly runs over it from the right to the left, trailed by four
                screaming fangirls. They run out of the picture, but Aang quickly comes back and
                traverses the bridge again, now from left to right. The girls are still following
                him, screaming loudly with the same amount of enthusiasm. They run out of the
                picture again, but once again, Aang runs back in. He runs up the bridge, but halts
                in the middle, looking from left to right as he sees that hordes of fangirls are
                trapping him on the bridge as they run up from both sides. Before they can reach
                him, the airbender leaps in the air. Cut to a closer shot of the girls in the middle
                of the bridge as they are still screaming and reaching for the sky. They gasp for
                air in admiration when they see that Aang is suspended in the air by clinging to an
                airball. The ball, however, slowly reduces in size until it vanishes completely.
                Aang looks scared as he drops down into the crowd of little girl who happily catch
                him.</description>
            <description>Switch to a shot of Aang and Koko standing serene with a waterfall in the
                background. A painter is measuring their proportions with his brush. Aang and Koko
                are obscured from sight as the artist raises his canvas and starts painting the
                outlines of Koko.</description>

                has pulled up next to Aang. Surprised.</charAction> Oh, there's another one ...
                <charAction>He obscures his models again from sight by raising his canvas and
                painting the outlines of the other girl.</charAction> Well, I'll make an adjustment
            here, and ... <charAction>He lowers the canvas to see that three more girls have joined
                Aang.</charAction> There's more ... <charAction>He obscures the Avatar and his
                fangirls from sight again with his canvas while he quickly paints Aang.</charAction>

        <speech>
            <description>The painter lowers his canvas again and discovers that Aang is now
                surrounded by sixteen little girls. The camera switches to the annoyed face of the
                painter. As he stares at his models, his brush drips on his painting. Close shot of
                Aang and the fangirls as they all push and pull to be as close to Aang as possible.
                They are all smiling widely and giggling while Aang looks somewhat horrified by all
                the girls around him. A side-view of the scene shows that some girls are completely
                leaning on others in order to have a spot on the painting. The painter gets up and
                walks away without saying a word, while the tower of people crashes under its own
                weight.</description>
            <description>Switch to a shot of Aang and his fangirls back in the village. A frontal
                shot of the monk shows that he is doing push-ups while Momo is sitting on his back
                and his fangirls have lined up in a semi-circle behind him. After three push-ups,
                Aang starts to do one handed push-ups and soon switches to no handed push-ups, but
                pushing himself up with his airbending. The girls stare at him in admiration. Cut to
                a wider view as Katara walks past carrying a basket. A look of disapproval dons her
                face as she keeps on walking without even glancing at the Avatar.</description>
            <description>Cut to a shot of a small house surrounded by trees. Sokka walks up to

            <description>Inside the house, six Kyoshi Warriors are training. They are performing a

            <description>The camera switches position and shows the other female warrior giggling

        <speech>
            <description>While he is talking, Sokka takes on a fighting stance while Suki has not
                moved a muscle from the position Sokka has put her in. Sokka bends through his knees
                and attacks the female warrior by trying to punch her. Suki does not move, but
                easily defends herself by bringing up her left arm and thrusting her closed fan
                against Sokka's shoulder. His cries out in pain and staggers backward.</description>

            <description>Suki quickly dodges under Sokka's outstretched leg and pushes him off
                balance. When the Water Tribe warrior lands flat on his back with a loud thud, Suki
                lazily opens her fans to wave herself some air. Sokka, a little shocked by his
                second failure, loses his temper at the sight of Suki's defiant
                posture.</description>

            <description>He gets up and madly charges her again. Suki quickly closes her fan and
                moves out of Sokka's way. She grabs him by the arm with her right hand, while she
                pushes against his shoulder with her left hand, quickly spinning him around. After
                two turns, she switches position and spins Sokka in the other direction. Close-up of
                Sokka's distressed face as he is powerlessly being tossed around. Switch to a wider
                shot as Suki suddenly halts Sokka so he topples forward. Before falling down, Suki
                loosens Sokka's belt and ties his left hand to his right foot behind his back in one
                swift movement. Sokka tries so maintain his balance for a while by jumping on one
                leg, but it is not long before he loses footage and smacks down flat on his
                face.</description>

            <description>Scene switches to Sokka who is standing outside of the Kyoshi Warriors'

                warriors behind here. Sokka walks in and the Kyoshi Warriors interrupt their

            <description>Cut to an outside-view of Aang walking through town. Switch to a close-up
                of a small cup filled with water. Katara is sitting beside it and moving her left
                hand over the cup, bending the water inside it. The camera follows the rising of the
                water and the scene changes to a broader view of the room. Katara is looking
                concentrated at the water when Aang walks in. She moves the plume of water up and
                down, right and left.</description>

            <description>Aang angrily turns around to walk out of the door. Before he leaves,
                however, he already glances back to Katara with a sorrowful expression on his face.
                Right after he leaves the room, Katara crosses her arms in protection and glances at
                the door, looking sad as well. She turns her head and raises her eyes in a
                combination of annoyance and regret.</description>
            <description>Cut to a bird view shot of inside the Kyoshi Warriors' training dojo where
                Sokka is performing some exercises with a fan under the watchful eyes of

            <description>As a last move, he closes the fan on throws it out of the dojo. The object

        <speech>
            <description>Camera moves to an overview shot as the two warriors prepare to battle
                again. Suki opens her fan threateningly and starts to circle around
                Sokka.</description>
            <description>Cut to a back view scene of Aang swimming in the water, while his troop of

            <description>As the girls leave, the camera moves to a close-up of a disappointed Aang.
                He lowers himself to be partially under the water and starts blowing bubbles. Switch
                to a shot of the shore, where the last of the girls is leaving, but their place is
                taken by Katara who just arrived. Aang jumps up from the water and

            <description>Side-view of Aang swimming to the shore, when suddenly a giant dorsal fin
                appears from out of the water behind him. Close-up of Katara as her eyes open in
                shock and she draws a sharp breath in horror. Cut back to Aang, who is, still
                oblivious to the danger behind him, swimming toward her with a smile on his face.
                Suddenly Aang is swept away by a wave and lifted out of the water, while he is
                screaming in panic. He looks around to find himself sitting on the back of Unagi as
                the monstrous eel erects itself before him, and directs a powerful jet of water to
                him. Aang withstands the water by holding on to one of the smaller dorsal fins of
                Unagi. The animal charges Aang and tries to eat him, but Aang narrowly escapes by
                catching one of Unagi's whiskers. Screaming his lungs out, he dangles from side to

            <description>Cut to a shot from inside Unagi's mouth, looking out as Aang comes to a
                halt right in front of him. The enormous tongue moves from side to side in
                anticipation of the meal. Cut to a broader shot of the two as Unagi suddenly and
                violently moves his head in all directions, trying to snatch Aang of his
                whisker.</description>

            <description>Close-up of a terrified Aang as he holds on to the whisker for dear life.
                Unagi tosses him some more from side to side, and Aang finally lets go from the
                force and speed of the throw. He is thrown through the air, still screaming loudly,
                and smacks in the water, not so far from where Katara is standing on the shore. He
                emerges back to the surface, clearly unconscious with his tongue out of his mouth.
                The camera pans up to show a heavily panting and fully clothed Katara entering the
                water.</description>

            <description>Unagi shrieks and dives under to get to his unconscious prey. Close-up of a
                worried Katara who is moving toward Aang through the water as fast as she can. The
                camera switches between shots of a rapidly approaching shadow underneath the water
                of Unagi, and a heavily panting Katara in her frantic effort to reach Aang before
                the eel. The moment Katara reaches Aang and takes him into her arm, Unagi emerges
                right in front of them. In an attempt to get away, Katara violently pushes the
                water, propelling herself and Aang backward with her waterbending; at the same time,
                Unagi snatches the water where they were just moments before. Although missing the
                duo, the impact of Unagi's attack creates a giant wave that slams Katara and Aang
                back to the rocks on shore. Angered, the animal spews power streams of water to the
                rocks before submerging again.</description>

                Zuko and his man ride past Katara and Aang's hiding place. Katara protectively
                covers the body of the still unconscious Aang, while worriedly looking up and
                hearing the riders move past. When she is certain the riders have pass, Katara lays

                duo below him train. The camera moves closer to the duo on the ground, where Suki

                shot of two rhinos with their riders as one of the Kyoshi Warriors quickly passes
                them by behind some houses. Cut to a frontal view of the three rhinos, before
                switching to a shot of the running feet of a Kyoshi Warrior atop a snowy roof. When
                she pushes herself off, the scene switches to a frog view of the three rhinos and
                there riders as three Kyoshi Warriors come jumping toward them from atop nearby
                roofs, knocking off some of the riders. A Kyoshi Warriors lands in front of the lead
                rhino and opens her fans. The rider stabs at her with his spear. She moves to the
                right, disarms the rider, and jumps up to knock him off his steed with a spinning
                kick. Suki can be seen running past in the background.</description>
            <description>Cut to a frontal view of a concentrated Suki while she runs toward Zuko.
                Switch to a back view of Suki, who moves to the left to avoid a fire blast of the
                prince. She jumps over another blast and tries to attack Zuko from the air, but he
                turns his rhino. The beast slams Suki away with a might sweep of his tail, knocking
                her down. Zuko shoots a fire blast at the downed warrior, but right before it would
                have burned her, Sokka jumps before her and decimates the flames with a sweep of his
                fan. Sokka prepares to fight Zuko, but before he can do anything, another Kyoshi
                Warrior jumps of a nearby roof and knocks a surprised Zuko of his rhino; the beast
                dashes away.</description>

                angrily opening his eyes. The camera moves back to reveal how Sokka, Suki, and the
                other Kyoshi Warrior all take on a fighting stance. Zuko pushes himself up and
                rapidly spins around on his hand while shooting fire out of his feet, knocking the
                Kyoshi Warrior back into the house and slamming Suki against a wooden pole, where
                she collapses in pain. Zuko proceeds with a low fire kick in Sokka's direction. The
                Water Tribe Warrior jumps over the fire, but as soon as he lands again, Zuko sweeps
                his feet from underneath him. Sokka falls in his back, and Zuko jumps over him to
                the middle of the street. He angrily looks around. Camera moves back to reveal the
                completely deserted street.</description>

            <description>Zuko commences by sending two fire balls in Aang's direction. Back view of
                Aang as he prepares to face the incoming, burning projectiles. He ducks underneath
                the first and uses his staff to decimate the next fire ball. He rapidly spins the
                staff over his head, propelling himself in the air. He lands in front of Zuko, who
                immediately kicks the staff out of his hands. Aang jumps up and lands between two
                fans of a Kyoshi Warrior that are lying on the ground. He stands up and picks us the
                fan with his airbending. Close-up of Zuko, who madly charges Aang with his fist
                already held stretched out before him. Aang spins around a few times to create a
                bigger momentum and uses the extra power of his swirl to blast Zuko in a nearby
                house with a strong blast of air. Aang looks sad and lowers the fans. He runs down
                the main street and picks up his staff along the way. Aang tosses the object in the
                air, where it snaps open into his glider and jumps on. A close-up of a saddened
                Aang, switches to the scene he is seeing: a lot of burning houses and the Fire
                Nation troops among them. Aang looks back to see the burning statue of Avatar
                Kyoshi, which saddens Aang even more.</description>

                camera moves backward through an ally. Two retreating Warriors can be soon,

                make-up, peering over the edge of the saddle, wide-eyed in chock. Momo peeks over
                the rim as well beside Katara. Cut back to a shot of the surface, where a few
                ripples reveal the nearing emerging of something. The water bubbles and suddenly
                Unagi shoots out of the water with Aang on top of his head, holding his whiskers.
                After swaying about a few times, he sturdies himself atop Unagi's head and pulls the
