            <description>Opening shot of the sun setting behind some tall rock outcroppings. The sky
                is mostly cloudy and the clouds reflect the light of the dying sun. Pan down to show
                a patched up tent being jostled about from the inside. A rolled up tarp lies next to
                the tent. Sokka is inside a tent, trying to assemble it. Sokka can be heard grunting
                and fussing about as he tries to finish setting up the shelter. Katara walks in the
                frame, her back to the camera, with a pile of fire wood in her arms.</description>

        <speech>Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Right, got it ... <charAction>Tosses the wrapped up tarp inside the
                tent.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp <description>on top</description> of the
            tent. You know, so we don't get rained on? <charAction>Cut to an overhead shot of the
                two, Sokka gesturing widely as he replies to his sister.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Ordinarily, you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not. Besides
            that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>But what if it does rain?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Spreading his arms wide in exasperation.</charAction> What if it
            doesn't? Then I would have put up the tarp for nothing.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>You're infuriating!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Katara, why don't you worry about gathering firewood, because that kindling is
            looking pretty sorry.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Angrily.</charAction> Well, if you don't like my firewood-
                <charAction>Throws the sticks at Sokka who shields himself from the wood. He stands
                in anger after the hail of sticks subsides.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Angrily.</charAction> Fine by me, if you're not gonna do your job-
                <charAction>He tears the tent down and the two stare at each other angrily as Aang
                approaches.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the- <charAction>The siblings turn away from
                each other in anger with their arms folded.</charAction> hey, where's the campfire?
            And what happened to the tent?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Why don't you ask Miss Know-It-All, Queen of the Twigs.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>Oh yeah? Well, you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the <charAction>Picks up and throws a
                twig at Sokka's head.</charAction> Tents! <charAction>Sokka turns around, looking
                angrily at her.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Laughs.</charAction> Okay, listen guys, harsh words won't solve
            problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>Sounds good.</speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Grinning while gloating.</charAction> You see that? Settling feuds and
            making peace, all in a day's work for the Avatar. <charAction>Turns his head to see Momo
                and Appa fighting over a watermelon. Momo continuously tries to fly away with it,
                while Appa pins it down. Aang takes the melon and uses airbending to slice it. Momo
                seems to be complaining about how he got the much smaller half and Appa got the
                bigger half.</charAction> Come on, Momo, that's fair. Appa's got five stomachs.
                <charAction>Appa eats his half of the melon.</charAction></speech>

        <speech>
            <description>The scene fades to show the group standing on the edge of a huge
                canyon.</description>

        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>

        <speech><charAction>In awe.</charAction> Wow, I could just stare at it forever.
                <charAction>Zoom backward to show Sokka in the foreground.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Okay, I've seen enough.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>How can you not be fascinated Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly
            away.</speech>

        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>Ooh, canyon guide? Sounds informative.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Gan Jin tribesman">Gan Jin tribesman</speaker>
        <speech>Believe me, he's more than a tour guide, he's an earthbender, <charAction>Oblivious
                to the fact that Sokka is behind him, mocking him.</charAction> and the only way in
            and out of the canyon is with his help, and he's taking my
            tribe across next.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Calm down, we know you're next.</speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Gan Jin tribesman">Gan Jin tribesman</speaker>
        <speech>You wouldn't be so calm if the Fire Nation destroyed your home and forced you> to
            flee! My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing
            Se.</speech>

        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>

        <speech>Huh, tell me something I don't know.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>A large group of poorly dressed people is shown walking toward
                them.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>Is that your tribe?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Gan Jin tribesman">Gan Jin tribesman</speaker>
        <speech>It most certainly is not! That's the Zhang tribe, a bunch of low-life thieves.
            They've been the enemies of my tribe for a hundred years. <charAction>Whistles to
                them.</charAction> Hey, Zhangs! I'm saving a spot for my tribe so don't even think
            about stealing it!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Zhang leader">Zhang leader</speaker>
        <speech>Where are the rest of the Gan Jin? Still tidying up their camp site?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Gan Jin tribesman">Gan Jin tribesman</speaker>
        <speech>Yes, but they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Zhang leader">Zhang leader</speaker>
        <speech>I didn't know the canyon guide took reservations.</speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Gan Jin tribesman">Gan Jin tribesman</speaker>
        <speech>Ha, of course you didn't! That's the ignorance I'd expect from <description>a messy
                Zhang.</description> So unorganized and ill-prepared for a journey. <charAction>The
                Zhang tribe members yell out in protest behind them. Katara and Aang look at each
                other worriedly, but turn around to see a large pile of rocks being levitated up and
                thrown away. The canyon guide stands behind where the rocks used to
            be.</charAction></speech>

        <speaker name="Canyon guide">Canyon guide</speaker>
        <speech>Sorry about the wait, youngsters. Who's ready to cross this here canyon?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>Uh, one of them, I think. <charAction>Camera pans left to reveal the Zhang and the

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Canyon guide">Canyon guide</speaker>
        <speech>I can't guide people who aren't here. <charAction>Cut to a wider shot showing the
                Zhang filing past the three kids and the fuming Gan Jin scout.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Zhang leader">Zhang leader</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Mockingly.</charAction> Guess you guys will have to make the trip
            tomorrow.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The shot shifts to a close-up the scout, whose eyes twitch in anger. The
                camera zooms backward and pans left to reveal another tribe entering the canyon
                entrance area. The scout points to them in triumph.</description>

        <speech><charAction>To the canyon guide.</charAction> You're not seriously gonna cave into

        <speech>Maybe you Zhangs wouldn't have so many sick people if you weren't such

    <p>
        <speaker name="Zhang leader">Zhang leader</speaker>
        <speech>If you Gan Jins weren't so clean, you wouldn't live to be so old.</speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>I don't know, a fight over chores is one thing, but these people have been feuding

        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Stepping forward.</charAction> Everybody listen up! This is the Avatar,
            and if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Uh, you could share the earthbender and travel
            together?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Gan Jin leader">Gan Jin leader</speaker>
        <speech>Absolutely not! We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation than travel with those

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Zhang leader">Zhang leader</speaker>
        <speech>We wouldn't travel with those pompous fools anyway! <charAction>The two tribes begin

        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Shouting.</charAction> All right here's the deal, you're all going down
            together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across! Does that seem fair?
                <charAction>Both leaders nod in agreement, and the scene fades to show the sick and
                elderly boarding Appa.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>

        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Aang, this feuding tribe stuff is serious business. Are you sure it's a good idea

        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Grinning broadly.</charAction> To tell you the truth, I'm not sure. But

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Canyon guide">Canyon guide</speaker>
        <speech>Okay, now comes the bad news. <charAction>Cut to a frontal shot of the
                guide.</charAction> No food allowed in the canyon, it attracts <charAction>He makes
                motions with his hands to illustrate the skittery monsters that might lurk in the
                canyon.</charAction>
            dangerous predators. <charAction>Both tribes yell out in

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Gan Jin Leader">Gan Jin Leader</speaker>
        <speech>No food?! This is ridiculous.</speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Canyon guide">Canyon guide</speaker>
        <speech>Oh, you babies can go a day without food? Would you rather be hungry, or dead?
                <charAction>He raises an earth pillar to tower over the rest. He continues, cupping
                his hands to his mouth to amplify his voice.</charAction> Now, we're heading down in
            ten minutes. All food better be in your gut or in the garbage!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The Zhang tribe quickly whips out and shoves food into their mouths, which
                stands in stark contrast to the Gan Jin tribe, who eat slowly with

            buddy! Yip yip! <charAction>Appa roars and takes off. The camera fades to show both
                groups of people climbing down into the canyon. The tour guide earthbends to form a
                bridge in a gap in the path.</charAction></speech>

        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Canyon guide">Canyon guide</speaker>
        <speech>The job's much more than bending, kid. Folks want information. <charAction>Turns to
                the travelers.</charAction> Many of you are probably wondering how canyons are
            formed. Experts tell us this canyon was most likely carved into the ground by earth
            spirits who were angry at local farmers for not offering them a proper
            sacrifice.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Katara and Sokka look up in fear as an avalanche of rocks comes falling
                toward them, and the canyon guide earthbends it away from them.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Canyon guide">Canyon guide</speaker>
        <speech>He he he, guess the spirits are still angry! Hope you all brought
            sacrifices.</speech>

        <speech>
            <description>Cut to a wide shot of the canyon floor and the canyon wall on the right
                side of the screen. The view pans slowly rightward before cutting to a closer,
                overhead shot of the group now at the bottom of the switchback trail. They have just
                entered the canyon floor. The guide stands in front of the two tribes and the kids.
                Katara, Aang, and Sokka look at each other in exasperation and the scene fades to
                show them standing at the bottom of the canyon next to a huge boulder.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Canyon guide">Canyon guide</speaker>
        <speech>Okay, everyone stand clear of the wall. <charAction>He throws the boulder and
                destroys the bridge he had made earlier.</charAction></speech>

        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>

        <speech>These people are fleeing the Fire Nation, aren't they? Gotta make sure we can't be
            followed. We'll be safe now. <charAction>Yells out, as he is picked up by a huge animal.
                Aang blows away the dust to reveal a canyon crawler.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>We gotta help him! <charAction>He throws his boomerang at the crawler, which drops

            warrior who was assigned an important duty, transporting our sacred orb from the great
            eastern gate, to the great western gate. Taking the orb from the east to the west
            represents the sun's rising and setting. It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual.
            But as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang, a vermin named
            Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy. That coward Wei Jin knocked Jin Wei to the
            ground, and stole our sacred orb. <charAction>Camera goes back to the Gan Jin leader's

            the distance. It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground. Noble
            Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb, a very powerful
            relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual. Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds
            but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important, and asked him to take it back to his
            tribe. Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could, but as Wei
            Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory, he was arrested.
            Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed, they sentenced him to twenty
            long years in prison. <charAction>Back to Zhang leader.</charAction> We Zhangs will

        <speech>Yes, yes, we're all aware of the story.</speech>

        <speech>No, I mean I really knew them. I might not look it, but
            I'm a hundred and twelve years old. I was there one hundred years ago on the day you're
            talking about. <charAction>Scene fades to show the two men facing each other.
                Voice-over.</charAction> There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened.
            First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies. They were brothers, twins in fact,
            and they were eight; and most importantly, they were just playing a game! The sacred orb
            from the legend, that was the ball! And the eastern and western gates were the goal
            posts. Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it.
            Wei Jin didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it toward the other
            goal, but he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box. Not for
            twenty long years but for two short minutes. <charAction>Fades back to
                Aang.</charAction> There was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison, it was
            just a game.</speech>

        <speech>You're saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball?</speech>

        <speech>Nope, just a regular ball.</speech>

        <speech>What about our tribe's redemption ritual?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>That's what the game was called, redemption. As soon as you got the ball from one
            end to the other, everyone would yell "redemption"! <charAction>The tribe leaders look
                at each other skeptically.</charAction> Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a
            slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true. But they respected each other's
            differences enough to share the same playing field.</speech>
