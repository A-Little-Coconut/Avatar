            <description>The episode opens to Team Avatar's place of stay in Ba Sing Se, where Sokka
                is drawing inaccurate pictures of Appa for missing posters. Katara and Aang
                enter.</description>

        <speech><charAction>Cheerfully.</charAction> We found a printer to make our posters!

            it.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Hey, I thought designing the lost Appa poster was my job. I've been working all day
            on my Appa! <charAction>Shows his crudely drawn picture of Appa with a proud smile. Cut
                to an exasperated Aang while Katara tries to hold back her
            laughter.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Sokka, the arrow is on Appa's head.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Dismayed.</charAction> This is his head. <charAction>Points to the
                sketch.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Takes the picture from Sokka, looks confused.</charAction> Why are feet
            coming out of it?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Snatches back the picture indignantly.</charAction> Those are his horns.
                <charAction>Hangs his head.</charAction> I haven't seen him in a while,
            okay?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Mockingly.</charAction> It looks just like him to me!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Thank you, I worked really- <charAction>Suddenly remembering that she is
                blind.</charAction> Why do you feel the need to do that?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>Let's just stick with the professional version.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Sokka angrily rips up his drawing.</description>
        </speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Excitedly.</charAction> Come on, let's get busy! <charAction>Holds up
                some pamphlets.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut to Aang and Momo dropping dozens of posters all over Ba Sing Se. One
                poster falls in front of the camera, and the scene changes to tea shop where Zuko
                and Iroh are working. Iroh serves tea to two customers, who enjoy it. They approach
                him.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Quon">Quon</speaker>
        <speech>So, you're the genius behind this incredible brew. The whole city is buzzing about
            you! I hope Pao pays you well.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>
        <speech>Good tea is its own reward.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Quon">Quon</speaker>
        <speech>But it doesn't have to be the only reward. How would you
            like to have your own tea shop?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Frontal view. Pao looks around, concerned.</charAction> My own tea shop?
            This is a dream come true!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pao">Pao</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Quickly moving to stand between the group.</charAction> What's going on
            here? Are you trying to poach my tea-maker?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Quon">Quon</speaker>
        <speech>Sorry Pao, but that's business for you, am I right?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pao">Pao</speaker>
        <speech>Mushi, if you stay, I'll make you assistant manager. Wait, senior assistant
            manager!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Quon">Quon</speaker>
        <speech>I'll provide you with a new apartment in the Upper Ring. <charAction>Cut to Zuko,
                who was busy putting empty tea cups on a tray, but now looks up and glances over his
                shoulder to follow Quon's offer more closely; voice-over.</charAction> The tea shop
            is yours to do whatever you want, <charAction>Cut back to frontal shot of
                Quon.</charAction> complete creative freedom.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>
        <speech>I even get to name the shop?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Quon">Quon</speaker>
        <speech>Of course!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pao">Pao</speaker>
        <speech>Uh, senior executive assistant manager?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Iroh hands him the pot of tea and bows to the customer, agreeing to the
                terms. Zuko walks by, as Pao walks away sadly.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>
        <speech>Did you hear, nephew? This man wants to give us our own tea shop in the Upper Ring
            of the city!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Quon">Quon</speaker>
        <speech>That's right, young man, your life is about to change for the better!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Zuko">Zuko</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> I'll try to contain my joy.
                <charAction>Walks outside, slams door shut.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>As he walks outside, he grabs a falling Appa poster. He climbs to the top
                of a house and notices several of them falling, searching the skies for any sign of
                the Avatar. He glances down again at the Appa poster. Camera zooms in as he looks up
                from the poster with a determined look on his face.</description>
            <description>Back at the house. Sokka and Katara are playing a game. Toph is just
                relaxing as Aang re-enters.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>I just finished dropping all the leaflets. Has anyone come in with news about
            Appa?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>It's only been a day. Just be patient. <charAction>Aang sits,
                unenthused.</charAction> </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>A knock at the door and Aang jumps up and runs to the door.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Wow, you're right! Patience really pays off! <charAction>Opens the door, revealing
                the "original" Joo Dee has returned.</charAction> Joo Dee?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Joo Dee">Joo Dee</speaker>
        <speech>Hello, Aang, and Katara, and Sokka, and Toph.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>They approach as Joo Dee enters.</charAction> What happened to you? Did
            the Dai Li throw you in jail?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Joo Dee">Joo Dee</speaker>
        <speech>What? Jail? Of course not. The Dai Li are the protectors of our cultural
            heritage.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>
        <speech>But you disappeared at the Earth King's party.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Joo Dee">Joo Dee</speaker>
        <speech>Oh, I simply took a short vacation to Lake Laogai, out in the country. It was quite
            relaxing. <charAction>Sokka glares at her skeptically.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>But then they replaced you with some other woman who also said her name was Joo
            Dee.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Joo Dee">Joo Dee</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Surprised.</charAction> I'm Joo Dee.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Why are you here?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Joo Dee">Joo Dee</speaker>
        <speech>Dropping fliers and putting up posters isn't permitted within the city. Not without
            proper clearance.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>We can't wait around to get permission for everything.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Joo Dee">Joo Dee</speaker>
        <speech>You are absolutely forbidden by the rules of the city to continue putting up
            posters.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Angrily yelling; during this brief argument, Aang is shown as a chibi
                and his head turns scarlet red.</charAction> We don't care about the rules and we're
                not asking permission! <charAction>Camera cuts to Joo
                Dee's horrified face. She slowly backs out of the house as Aang continues to yell at
                her.</charAction> We're finding Appa on our own and you should just stay out of our
            way! <charAction>Slams the door as she exits.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>That might come back to bite us in the blubber.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Calming down.</charAction> I don't care! From now on, we do whatever it
            takes to find Appa!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>
        <speech>Yeah, let's break some rules! <charAction>Takes out a side of the house with
                earthbending.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Momo flies out the broken side of the house and they all exit. Two Dai Li
                agents watch overhead from a house roof across the street. </description>
            <description>The scene changes to the Royal Palace, where Long Feng meets with that
                particular Joo Dee. Two Dai Li agents stand guard.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Long Feng">Long Feng</speaker>
        <speech>I'm very disappointed in your work with the Avatar and his friends, Joo Dee. I had
            hoped that you would be able to control this situation.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Joo Dee">Joo Dee</speaker>
        <speech>I am so sorry, but they don't trust me anymore. <charAction>Starts getting
                upset.</charAction> I don't think I can keep working like this! <charAction>Begins
                to sob.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Long Feng">Long Feng</speaker>
        <speech>Joo Dee, the Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Joo Dee">Joo Dee</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Camera zooms toward her eye as its iris dilates; in a monotone
                voice.</charAction> I am honored to accept his invitation.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Long Feng">Long Feng</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Nods.</charAction> Good. Now go await further orders. <charAction>Joo
                Dee nods and begins to exit. Long Feng gets up and moves to the
                fireplace.</charAction> If the Avatar keeps searching for his bison, it could upset
            the delicate balance we've worked so hard to achieve in this city. It could even cost us
            control of the Earth King.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Dai Li agent">Dai Li agent</speaker>
        <speech>Should we take care of him?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Long Feng">Long Feng</speaker>
        <speech>No. It's much too dangerous for us to confront him directly. Let's see if we can
            still handle this quietly.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>At Iroh and Zuko's place of stay, which is about to change. Zuko enters
                Iroh's room. Iroh is packing his clothes.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>
        <speech>So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How about the Jasmine Dragon?
            It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Zuko">Zuko</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Shows Iroh the flyer.</charAction> The Avatar is here in Ba Sing Se and
            he's lost his bison.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Grabs the flyer.</charAction> We have a chance for a new life here.
                <charAction>Cut to Zuko looking out a window.</charAction> If you start stirring up
            trouble, we could lose all the good things that are happening for us.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Zuko">Zuko</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Turns to Iroh.</charAction> Good things that are happening for
                you! Have you ever thought that I want more from life
            than a nice apartment and a job serving tea?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>
        <speech>There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think
            about what it is that you want from your life and why.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Zuko">Zuko</speaker>
        <speech>I want my destiny.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>
        <speech>What that means is up to you. <charAction>Zuko walks away. Continues brainstorming
                names for his new tea shop.</charAction> The Tea Weevil! No, that's stupid.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Cut back to Team Avatar, who are working to put up more
                posters.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>We'll split up to cover more area. Toph, I guess you should just come with
            me.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Peevishly.</charAction> Why? Because you think I can't put up posters on
            my own?! <charAction>Angrily takes the paintbrush of glue from Sokka and throws glue on
                the wall. She slams a poster on it, but it is backward. Awkward pause.</charAction>
            It's upside-down, isn't it? I'll just go with Sokka.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>They all go their separate ways, with Toph following Sokka. Cut to an open
                square, where Katara is putting up a poster on a stone plinth near a flowing water
                stream. Suddenly, behind her, she hears a familiar voice call out.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Jet">Jet</speaker>
        <speech>Katara?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Jet is seen emerging from an alleyway at the edge of the square. Katara
                wheels around with a startled gasp.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Jet">Jet</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Walks closer. Smiling confidently.</charAction> I think I can help you.
                <charAction>Katara's shocked blush transforms into a look of pure outrage. With a
                sweep of her arms, she bends up water from a lake directly at him while screaming in
                rage. Jet looks at the wave in fright.</charAction> Katara, I've changed!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The wave hits Jet, sending him back quite a distance.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Bending up remaining water from the wave.</charAction> Tell it to some
            other girl, Jet! <charAction>Turns the water to ice, which sends Jet back to a
                wall.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Jet">Jet</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Blocks the ice with his swords.</charAction> I don't want to fight you,
            I'm here to help!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Throws his swords down, and reaches for something behind his back. Katara
                quickly fires more ice crystals, which pin him to the wall. The rest of the team
                approaches.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>Katara, what is it?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>Jet's back. <charAction>Close-up of Jet's face. Cut to aerial view before switching
                to a closer view of the group.</charAction> We can't trust anything Jet
            says.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Sokka">Sokka</speaker>
        <speech>But we don't even know why he's here!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>I don't care why he's here, whatever the reason is, it can't be good!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Jet">Jet</speaker>
        <speech>I'm here to help you find Appa! <charAction>Opens his hand and reveals he is holding
                a missing Appa poster.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Turning from the leaflet back to Katara.</charAction> Katara, we have to
            give him a chance.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Jet">Jet</speaker>

            <description>Toph saves them by creating a rock wall and she raises ground up. Toph
                knocks away the four Dai Li agents that attack her, but a glove captures her and Jet
                swings by to free her. The agent fires his other rock glove, and Longshot fires an
                arrow, which destroys the glove. Jet jumps in front of Longshot to hold off more of
                their rock attacks. Long Feng escapes.</description>

            <description>Jet resumes his attempts at attacking Aang, who dodges them and uses

    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>At these final words, Jet straightens in shock. Everything goes white and
                he has a rapid flashback of his past as a Freedom Fighter, seeing Longshot,
                Smellerbee, Pipsqueak and the Duke, and him with Katara. The Freedom Fighters cheer
                fades to him with Smellerbee and Longshot, before showing him sitting down with Iroh
                and Zuko. Fade to him giving the passengers food, and quickly to him being dragged
                away by the Dai Li. Fade more rapidly to Jet's brainwashing, and to Long Feng on
                Lake Laogai. Cut to his burning village, to Iroh, to him with Zuko, to him with
                Katara, to him watching his burning village crying. Cut to him in a Fire Nation
                camp, to him with Katara, and to him being brainwashed. Cut back to him crying while
                watching his village burn as Mongke watches. The flashback ends and Jet's irises
                return to normal.</description>

            <description>The rest of the group arrives, all struck with sorrow and shock as they
                gather around Jet. Katara stares open-mouthed at Jet, her hands hovering near her
                mouth in shock. Snapping out of it, she withdraws water from her water skin, with
                which she covers her hands, and it begins to glow as she kneels down next to him.
                Cut to a shot from over her shoulder, with Jet glancing at her while she rubs her
                hands over his chest in an attempt to heal him. After rubbing his chest three times,
                the glow fades, the water stains Jet's clothing, and Katara looks back over her
                shoulder toward the rest of the group.</description>

                way to the other exit and standing guard, prepping an arrow. Smellerbee is seen
                kneeling next to Jet, rubbing her hands back and forth over him, with her right hand
                on his forehead.</description>
