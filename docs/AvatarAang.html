        <p>Aang is a male Air Nomad who was successor to Avatar Roku. As a young avatar he knew he was the only person capable of bending all four elements and keeping the peace between the nations. As an Air Nomad, he only knew how to airbend. So, he began to feel the pressure that comes with being an avatar. A little before the 100 year war, Avatar Aang went missing after running away from his duties as avatar. While in the avatar state, Aang froze himself and his pet bison, Appa, in an iceburg for 100 years. When found by two teenagers from the Southern Waterbending Tribe, Katara and Sokka, he emerged. Aang was told what had happened to the nations after he left. He realized he needed to learn how to bend the other elements to restore order to the nations. Katara, Sokka, and Aang go on a quest to help Aang learn the other elements and save the world. </p>
