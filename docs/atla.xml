                Though he does not have any bending powers, he is proficient in physical combat with
                both his sword and boomerang.As the self-proclaimed "plan guy" of the group, Sokka
                was quick to come up with. Though he often acts as the show's comic relief, he tends
                to be serious when the situation calls for it.</desc>
