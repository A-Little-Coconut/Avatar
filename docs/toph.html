                        <p>Toph Beifong is an earthbender, and one to the most powerful at that. Toph was born blind, so she was treated differently because of her impairment. However, her blindness turned out to be her super power when she discovered earthbending animals called badgermoles. Badgemoles are blind too, so through them she learned how to use her other senses to improve her bending and "see" vibrations that pass through the ground. She was also the first earthbender to learn the extension of "metalbending".Unbeknownst to her parents, Toph is known as the "Blind Bandit" to many because of her consistent winning reputation in underground earthbending competitions. When she learned of Aang's mission to save the world she wasn't interested, but decided to join the cause due to her overprotective parents. Toph travelled with Aang and his friends as Aang's earthbending coach. </p>
